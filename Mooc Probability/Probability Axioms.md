1. **Nonnegativity** P(A) >= 0 for every event A
	1. probability of something occurring must be more than or equal to 0
	2. probability of something occurring must also be less than 1, however it can be derived with other 3 axioms
2. **Additivity**: If A and B are two disjoint events than the probability of their union
	1. P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) basically probability of A occurring combined with the probability of B occurring is the same as the probability of either A or B occurring.
	2. If there are a sequence of sets which are disjoint, we are allowed to add the sum of the probabilities. - **Countable Additivity Axiom**
	3. Only applies to **countable infinite sets** - e.g. real integers
	4. Unit square or real line is an uncountable set since the elements cannot be arranged in a sequence.
	5. ![[Probability]]
3. **Normalization:** Probability of the entire sample space is equal to 1. (as the chance of picking any one of the [[Probabilistic Models|possible outcomes]] is 1)
4. **Probability is only assigned to sets, hence if you want to find the probability of a specific outcome, you write P({X}) with curly brackets, as that creates a set.**

Definitions: 
-  **Event:** A subset of the sample space.
- **Disjoint events:** events that never occur at the same time - mutually exclusive (either A or B happens, not both at the same time)
- **Uniform law for e.g. a continuous set:** Probability = Area
