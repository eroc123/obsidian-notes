![[Von Neumann model diagram.canvas|Diagram]]
- Consists of a central processing unit and a memory unit, with both of them communicating to each other
- Single shared memory for programs and data
- Single bus for memory access (between CPU and Memory Unit)
- **Within CPU:**
	- [[Arithmetic unit]]
	- Control unit ^controlUnit
### Stored Program Concept

- Machine code instructions stored in main memory
- These instructions are loaded from the main memory into the processor where it gets executed serially by a processor that performs arithmetic and logical operations
- Called fetch-execute cycle (instructions fetched from memory, executed in processor)
