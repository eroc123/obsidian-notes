- Consists of many communication lines
- Data can be transmitted in both directions at the same time (full duplex data transmission)
- The communication passes through many switching centers when calling from one telephone to another. 
- When a call is being made, a specific line is occupied and no one else can use it.
- When a call is finished, the specific line is freed up for someone else to use
- Dial-ups and modems used PTSN to connect to the internet.
- Over time PTSN was upgraded to fibre optic and broadband connections.
