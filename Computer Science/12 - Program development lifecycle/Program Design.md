**Structure chart** - a modelling tool used to decompose a problem into a set of sub-tasks. Shows hierarchy or structure of the different models and how they connect with each other.

**Finite state machine** - mathematical model of a machine that can be in one state of a fixed set of possible states - one state is changed by another external input- known as a transition

**State-transition diagram** - a diagram showing the behaviour of a finite state machine (FSM).

**State-transition table** â€“ a table showing every state of a finite state machine (FSM), each possible input and the state after the input.
