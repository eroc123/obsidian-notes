- Develops different parts of the requirements in parallel
- e.g. team 1 produces parts of analysis, design, coding, testing and maintenance whilst team 2 produces other parts of analysis, design, coding, testing and maintenance.
- minimal planning needed
- reuses previously written code where possible, makes use of automated code generation where possible
- high customer involvement as customers can use prototypes during development
- ![[RAD]]
##### Benefits 
- reduced development time
- rapid frequent customer feedback informs development
- very flexible as requirements evolve from feedback during development
- as parts of the system are developed side by side, modification is easier because each part must work independently
##### Drawbacks
- system under development needs to be modular
- needs strong teams of skilled developers
- not suitable for short, simple projects
