# Iterative Model
;?;
- Kind of like a waterfall model repeated multiple times with extra details - incremental development
- First waterfall cycle starts of with a simple subset of requirements
- Second waterfall cycle then has a expansion of the model 
- Final waterfall cycle has the full system developed and completed.
- Suitable for projects where major requirements are known but details are likely to change
- High customer involvement as part of the system can be shown to the customer after every iteration

##### Benefits
;?;
- some working programs developed quickly at an early stage in the lifecycle
- Easier to test and debug smaller programs
- more flexible as easier to alter requirements
- Customers involved at each iteration therefore no surprises when final system delivered
##### Drawbacks 
- Whole system needs to be defined at start so it can be broken down into places to be developed at each iteration
- Needs good planning overall and for every stage
- Not suitable for simple short projects.
