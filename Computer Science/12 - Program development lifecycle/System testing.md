Alpha testing - testing of a completed or nearly completed program in house by the development team
- Done after system has been completed
- Tests **every** possible user flow (all ways a user can interact)
- Is rigorously structured - every flow is tested and all results recorded and analysed
- Done to check application is working as expected
Beta testing = testing of a completed program by a small group of users before its released
- Done to test real-world conditions and whether the program matches user expectations
- Done by public
- Completely unstructured, feedback requested but not required
