**[[Program development lifecycle]]** ;; the process of developing a program set out in five stages: analysis, design, coding, testing and maintenance

**[[Analysis]]** ;; step one of the development lifecycle - a process of investigation, leading to the specification of what a program is required to do.

**[[Design]]** ;; step two of the program development lifecycle - uses the program specification from the analysis stage to show how the program should be developed 

**[[Coding]]** ;; step three of the program development lifecycle - the writing of the program or suite of program

**[[Testing]]** ;; step four of the program development lifecycle - the writing of the program suite of programs

**[[Maintenance]]** ;; step five of the program development 

**[[Waterfall model]]** ;; a linear sequential program development cycle, in which each stage is completed before the next is begun.

**[[Iterative model]]** ;; a type of program development cycle in which a simple subset of the requirements is developed, then expanded or enhanced, with the development cycle being repeated until the full system has been developed. 

**[[Rapid application development (RAD)]]** ;; a type of program development cycle in which different parts of the requirements are developed in parallel, using prototyping to provide early user involvement in testing.

Table showing the process of dry-running a program with columns showing the values of each variable as it changes

Run-time error ;; an error found in a program when it is executed; the program may halt unexpectedly

Test strategy ;; an overview of the testing required to meet the requirements specified for a particular program; it shows how and when the program is to be tested

Test plan ;; a detailed list showing all the stages of testing and every test that will be performed for a particular program

Dry run ;; testing by running through program or module manually and tracing out the value of each variable

Walkthrough ;; formal version of a dry run with pre-defined test cases

Normal test data ;; data that should be accepted by a program

Abnormal test data ;; data that should be rejected by a program

Extreme data ;; data on the limit of being accepted by a program

Boundary test data ;; test data that is on the limit of that accepted by a program or data that is jut outside the limit of being rejected by a program

White-box testing ;; method of testing a program that tests the structure and logic of every path through a program module

Black-box testing ;; a method of testing a program that tests a module's inputs and outputs

Stub testing ;; use of dummy modules for testing

Acceptance testing ;; the testing of a completed program to prove to the customer that it works as intended

Corrective maintenance ;; correction of any errors that appear during use

Perfective maintenance ;; making improvements to the performance of a program

Adaptive maintenance ;; the alteration of a program to perform new tasks

Logic error ;; program doesn't do what it is supposed to do
