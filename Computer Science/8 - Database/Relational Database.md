**Relational databases is a type of database where records are stored in multiple tables which are linked with each other using relationships and identified using primary and foreign keys.**

**Benefits of relational databases over flat-file databases**
-  Reduced data redundancy // less repeated data 
	- …because each item of data is only stored once 
- Maintains data consistency // improves data integrity 
	- …changes in one table will automatically update in another 
	- ... linked data cannot be entered differently in two tables 
- Program-data independence 
	- …changes to the data do not require programs to be re-written 
- Complex queries are easier to run 
- Can provide different views 
	- ….so users can only see specific aspects of the database
