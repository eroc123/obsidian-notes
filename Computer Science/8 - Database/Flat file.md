**Flat file is where all the database records are in one table**

**Limitations:**
- Data redundancy - data is repeated and causes more storage space to be used.
- Data integrity issues - data that is updated in one individual won't automatically update the other records of that individual, meaning that each record has to be changed manually
- Complex queries are difficult to run on flat files
- Users can see the entire database, leading to privacy issues when there's fields that certain users should not have access to.
