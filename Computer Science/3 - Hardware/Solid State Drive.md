- Have no moving parts
- Data is retrieved at the same rate
- Store data by controlling electrons within NAND chips and is stored as 0's and 1's in transistors.

**Arrangement**
- Cells are the smallest unit - contain two transistors, one control gate and one floating gate and stores one value
- cells are organized into a larger grid pattern within the SSD (rows and columns)
- Cells make up a page.
- Pages make up blocks
- SSD's can only read and write data at the block level, so if information needs to be written, the whole block is deleted and rewritten.

**Advantages:**
- Random access (data doesn't need to be read in a sequence to access the intended data)
- More reliable (no moving parts)
- Are lighter (good for laptops)
- Lower power consumption
- Access data faster
**Disadvantage:**
- Unknown longevity of the technology - rated to have a limited capacity of read write
