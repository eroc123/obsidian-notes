- Uses lots of tiny transistors and capacitors
	- Each bit is a pair consisting of a transistor (changes the value) and capacitor (stores the value, either 0 or 1)
- Single RAM chip contains millions of these
- Capacitors hold bits (1,0's)
- Transistor allows for capacitors to be read or change the capacitors value
- Must be constantly refreshed to ensure capacitors hold value (or else they will leak charge and return to a value of 0)
