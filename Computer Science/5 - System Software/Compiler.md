- Compiler takes source code (that a programmer has made) and translates all of it into executable machine code
- Creates an executable (.exe) file.
- Must translate the entire source code before running it. (think of taking a novel and translating it through google translate before reading it)
- Once compiled, code does not need to be compiled again to run
	- Code has to be recompiled however if there is an error fix that is needed to be done. Any modification to code requires the code to be recompiled.
- User doesn't need access to source code, executable can be run anywhere without an interpreter needed

- **Good for programs which are com**
