- **Code already exists, saves time**
- **Code well tested, relatively less errors** (as its made by expert programmers and peer reviewed)
- **Can use mathematical and graphics functions you may not know how to code** 
- **Use of library functions can simplify the program, make it easier to read** (only an import function, instead of needing to write out the entire function)
- **Library code should conform to industry standards and therefore be robust and more readable** (experts made it, everyone uses the same code)
