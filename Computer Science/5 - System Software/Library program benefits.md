- **Code already exists, saves time**
- **Code well tested, relatively less errors** (as its made by expert programmers and p)
- **Can use mathematical and graphics functions you may not know how to code**
- **Use of library functions can simplify the program, make it easier to read**
- **Library code should conform to industry standards and therefore be robust and more readable**
