A program library is a collection of prewritten code that programmers can use to optimize tasks.
- An example would be built in libraries in python such as Math, which can be imported when it is required by the user. The user does not need to code functions such as square root and integrals. 

#### Advantages: 
- **Code already exists, saves time**
- **Code well tested, relatively less errors** (as its made by expert programmers and peer reviewed)
- **Can use mathematical and graphics functions you may not know how to code** 
- **Use of library functions can simplify the program, make it easier to read** (only an import function, instead of needing to write out the entire function)
- **Library code should conform to industry standards and therefore be robust and more readable** (experts made it, everyone uses the same code)
