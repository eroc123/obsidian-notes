- Decomposition of structured english to turn a complex task into multiple smaller, simpler steps
- In stepwise refinement, each smaller step should be able to be written as one line in a high level programming language.
e.g. 1. Enter the time in hours, minutes and seconds gets split into:

1.1 Enter the hours
1.2 Enter the minutes
1.3 Enter the seconds

- Each line can then be written in pseudocode as
INPUT Hours
INPUT Minutes
INPUT Seconds
