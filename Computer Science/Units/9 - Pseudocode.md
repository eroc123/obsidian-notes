##### 9.1 Computational Thinking Skills
Show an understanding of abstraction 
- Need for and benefits of using [[Computer Science/9 - Algorithm Design and Problem Solving/Key terms|abstraction]] 
- Describe the purpose of abstraction 
- Produce an abstract model of a system by only including essential details
Describe and use [[Computer Science/9 - Algorithm Design and Problem Solving/Key terms|decomposition]] 
- Break down problems into sub-problems leading to the concept of a program module (procedure / function)

Show understanding that an algorithm is a solution to a problem expressed as a sequence of defined steps 
-  Use suitable identifier names for the representation of data used by a problem and represent these using an [[identifier table]] 
- Write pseudocode that contains input, process and output Write pseudocode using the three basic constructs of sequence, selection and iteration (repetition) Document a simple algorithm using a structured English description, a flowchart or pseudocode Write pseudocode from: • a structured English description • a flowchart Draw a flowchart from: • a structured English description • pseudocode
