##### 10.1 Data Types and Records
Select and use appropriate [[Data types|data types]] for a problem solution 
-  including integer, real, char, string, Boolean, date (pseudocode will use the following data types: INTEGER, REAL, CHAR, STRING, BOOLEAN, DATE, ARRAY, FILE) 
Show understanding of the purpose of a record structure to hold a set of data of different data types under one identifier 
- Write pseudocode to define a [[Records|record]] structure 
- Write pseudocode to read data from a [[Records in Pseudocode|record]]

##### 10.2 Arrays
Use the technical terms associated with arrays 
- Including [[Arrays|index, upper and lower bound]]

Select a suitable data structure (1D or 2D array) to use for a given task 

Write pseudocode for [[1D arrays|1D]] and [[2D arrays|2D]] arrays 

Write pseudocode to process array data 
- Sort using a [[Bubble sort|bubble sort]]
- Search using a [[Linear Search|linear search]]

##### 10.3 Files

Show understanding of why files are needed 

Write pseudocode to handle text files that consist of one or more lines

##### 10.4 Introduction to Abstract Data Types (ADT)

Show understanding that an ADT is a collection of data and a set of operations on those data 

Show understanding that a stack, queue and linked list are examples of ADTs 
- Describe the key features of a stack, queue and linked list and justify their use for a given situation 

Use a stack, queue and linked list to store data 
- Candidates will not be required to write pseudocode for these structures, but they should be able to add, edit and delete data from these structures

Describe how a queue, stack and linked list can be implemented using arrays
