### 5.1 Operating Systems

Explain why a computer system requires an Operating System (OS) 
Explain the key management tasks carried out by the Operating System 
	• Including memory management, file management, security management, hardware management (input/output/peripherals), process management 
Show understanding of the need for typical utility software provided with an Operating System Including disk formatter, virus checker, defragmentation software, disk contents analysis/ disk repair software, file compression, back-up software 
Show understanding of program libraries 
Including: 
	• software under development is often constructed using existing code from program libraries 
	• the benefits to the developer of software constructed using library files, including Dynamic Link Library (DLL) files

### 5.2 Language Translators

Show understanding of the need for: 
	• assembler software for the translation of an assembly language program 
	• a compiler for the translation of a high-level language program 
	• an interpreter for translation and execution of a high-level language program 
Explain the benefits and drawbacks of using either a compiler or interpreter and justify the use of each 
Show awareness that high-level language programs may be partially compiled and partially interpreted, such as Java (console mode) 
Describe features found in a typical Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
	Including: 
	• for coding, including context-sensitive prompts
	 • for initial error detection, including dynamic syntax checks
	 • for presentation, including prettyprint, expand and collapse code blocks 
	 • for debugging, including single stepping, breakpoints, i.e. variables, expressions, report window
