- Program defines classes -> objects can then be defined based off a class. Class can contain methods (functions) and variables 
- e.g.
- Class Class1:
	- def \_\_init\_\_(self):
		- self.a = 1
		- self.b = 2
	- def addition(self):
		- return self.a + self.b

self.a and self.b are variables that are unique to a single instance of Class1. They can both have different datatypes. 

classEx = Class1() - creates an instance of Class1
classEx.addition() - runs the method addition as defined in the 

- ONLY exists in object-oriented programming languages
