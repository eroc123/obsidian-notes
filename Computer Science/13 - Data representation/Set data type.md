- Can create sets and apply mathematical operations in set theory. All elements in set must be unique

TYPE set1 = SET OF INTEGER - sets are made of elements with a built-in datatype
DEFINE numbers (1,2,3,4) : set1

**THE BELOW DOESNT WORK BECAUSE DATA IN SET MUST BE UNIQUE**

DEFINE numbers (1, 1, 2, 3) : set1
