- Files with no defined order - can store repeating lines separated with end of line character
- Similar to a [[Computer Science/10 - Data types and structures/Queue|Queue]] abstract datatype - records are added to the end of the file one after another.
- Must search through each record to find a given record [[Computer Science/10 - Data types and structures/Linear Search|Linear Search]]
