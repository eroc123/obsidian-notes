- user defined 
- **non - composite**
	- hence each element in the set has no datatype - no quotes or anything
- maps a **set** of names to a specific number
- is **ordered** and **countable**, with finite values in the set
	- hence when an enumerator is defined, incrementing the enumerator sets its value to the "next" element of the set, and values in the set can be compared to each other. 
- e.g. for a set called months

pseudocode example:

```
TYPE <Datatype> = (<value1>,<value2>,<value3>â€¦) 

DECLARE <identifier> : <datatype>

e.g.
TYPE Season = (Summer,Winter,Autumn,Spring) // Note: we are not writing
                                               Summer intead of "Summer" b/c
                                               it is a non-composite data type 
DECLARE ThisSeason : Season
DECLARE NextSeason : Season

ThisSeason <-- Autum 
NextSeason <-- ThisSeason + 1 // NextSeason is set to Spring
```
