- Also used to represent decimals and can be in [[obsidian-notes/Computer Science/1 - Information representation/One's and Two's complement|One's and Two's complement]]
- Real number (number with decimal) represented with  mantissa and exponent in base 2.
	- Similar to standard notation in science, e.g. 3 \* 10^8 except uses base two so its more like M x 2^e where e is the given exponent
	- Also similar to standard notation in science, floating point numbers should be **normalized** to save space. Basically represent as much as you can with exponent.
- e.g. if you have an 8 bit register, instead of having 4 bits allocated for whole number and 4 bits for fraction, you could have 4 bits allocated for mantissa and 4 bits allocated for exponent instead.
- Standard position of decimal point is always 1 from the left. eg. 0.110 0110
