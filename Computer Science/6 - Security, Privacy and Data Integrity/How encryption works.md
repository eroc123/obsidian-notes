[[Encryption|How it works]]
#### Two types of encryption

###### Asymmetric
- Two matching keys
- Public and private
- Share public key
- Never share private key
- Receiver's public key used to encrypt (produces cipher text)
- Receiver uses private key to decrypt (produces plain text)
###### Symmetric
- Single key
- For encryption and decryption
- Both parties need the key to allow for encryption and decryption
