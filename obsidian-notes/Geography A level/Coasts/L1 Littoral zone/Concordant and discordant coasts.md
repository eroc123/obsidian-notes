Fig 2.10 -  a diagram of how a discordant coastline looks like. Note the bands of rock that are perpendicular to the sea and the differential erosion that occurs. This is because of the difference between the hardness of the rocks of the different bands. Bays form in the bands of rock which are softer and headlands in the harder bands.

### Formation of a cove:

Fig 2.12 - a diagram showing the formation of a cove in a concordant coast

  

**In image A:**
1. A river flows through every rock layer in a concordant coast. 
2. The weaker clay band further inland erodes away much faster than the hard limestone layer near the coast 
3. This creates a pocket that floods with seawater and forms a cove

**In image B:**
1. The sea breaks through the hard limestone layer via a weakness in the rock band to the softer clay layers further inland
2. The clay layers erode away quickly and a pocket behind the hard limestone layer is formed
3. As the pocket expands, it fills with seawater and forms a cove
