## Key terms:

**Lithology:** The general physical characteristics of rocks in a certain geographical area. 
**Geological structure:** The way rocks are distributed and arranged in an area and how they have been altered (folded, heated, shaped, etc.) via tectonic or weathering processes.
**Porosity:** ability of rock to hold water
**Permeability:** how easily water can move through a rock layer.

## Factors that affect the shape of a coast - two main types, geological and waves

  

### Factors related to geology that can affect coasts include:

- **Resistance to weathering and erosion (how hard rocks are or whether they can be dissolved by acids)**
    
- Fig 2.1 - Folded rocks: How folded the rocks are (when rocks bend and crumple, kind of like different colours of play dough) ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MWkRmWECKnp_SElT0Z-oOowPU_ocJggl1F4_XTxrS44Xc_8wvfPAF2Y8R-k6JAsBwcAx85TUaIQXQc7LJVmhH0mrMAPfN7ve9kx043xV8Ly-WQWBzH1A356boaapBFDhDdY_j0a-2PSfz5qUeCw7QA)
**- Degree of consolidation (how compressed or stuck together the rocks are)**

### Factors related to waves that can affect coasts include:
- Energy 
- Size and shape 
- Fetch (the length of water over which wind has blown over unobstructed, the longer the stronger the wave generally is)
- Dominant wind direction (prevailing wind direction)
- Depth of nearshore and offshore water

## Geological structures

**Folds - formed due to pressure from tectonic activity which causes rocks to buckle.**

Fig 2.3 - fault shown in the rock face. Note the slip plane (the crack) where the layers have slipped and thus misaligned.

  

**Faults - When enough pressure (either internal or external) is applied to a rock to cause it to break. The rock then slips along the crack and creates a fault plane.**

**Joints (vertical cracks) - Caused by brittle fractures of rocks. Can be caused by cooling and contraction such as when sedimentary rocks dry out. Can also be caused by earth movements during uplifts.**

**Bedding planes (horizontal cracks)  - Natural breaks between rock layers caused due to gaps in time periods in rock formation.**

**Dip - The angle which rock layers (strata) lie.**

**Strata - rock layers**
