Fig 1.2: Sardinia, Mediterranean - Low-energy coast as evidenced by its beach and the relatively calm constructive waves. Also very sheltered as its in a bay.

Fig 1.3: Pacific Coast Canada - High-energy coast as evidenced by the rocky coast and cliffs (suggesting strong erosion) Looks to be more of a headland sticking out.

Fig 1.4: Atlantic coast, Scotland - High-energy coast as evidenced by cliffs, rocky coastline and lack of a beach, suggesting strong erosion from destructive waves. Since its facing the Atlantic ocean, waves generally have a large fetch, and thus can be assumed to have high energy.

Fig 1.5: East Anglia, UK - Low-energy coast as evidenced by flat beach. Suggests large amounts of deposition, which probably means there are constructive waves.
