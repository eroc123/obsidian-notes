![[Coaxial Cable.png]]

- Electrical cable which transmits radio frequency (RF) signals

**The cables are built with four layers like in the diagram above:**
1. Innermost layer: copper wire (conductor) which sends the data itself
2. Dielectric plastic insulator (an electrical insulator but can hold electric charge)
3. Braided copper mesh to shield from electromagnetic [[Interference and coherence]] (other electromagnetic waves like other radio waves disrupting the data being transferred)
4. External insulator to protect inside layers from damage
