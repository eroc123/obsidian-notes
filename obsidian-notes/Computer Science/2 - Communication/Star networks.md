- Uses a central hub or switch which each computer is connected to
- Each computer has a connection to the central node (server/hub/switch)
- Each computer has their own seperate connection to the hub/server/switch

**Advantages:**
- Data collisions reduced due to topology
- Easy to improve by upgrading hub
- If one of the connections is broken, only one of the nodes is affected
- More secure since security can be applied to central node
**Disadvantages:**
- Initial installation costs are high
- Central hub fails, entire network fails
