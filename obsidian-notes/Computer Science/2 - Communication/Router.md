- Router - links a network to the internet and routes data based on IP address.
	- e.g. a LAN to a WAN
	- Can be [[Gateway vs Router|gateways]] (link dissimilar networks)
	- Assigns private IP to devices on a LAN
	- acts as a firewall
	- they store, update and maintain a routing table

- Routers listen in to data packets coming from the internet and see if the IP address associated with the data packets is intended for the specific router. The router forwards data packets to their intended destination
- e.g. if the router's IP is blue, then it will reject all data packets which are not blue and accept packets which are blue (just an analogy, ip's dont have a colour)
