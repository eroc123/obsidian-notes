- Uses a single central cable to connect all computers and devices

**Advantages:**
- Easy to expand
- Requires little cabling
- Even if one node fails, the rest still works
**Disadvantages:**
- Data can only travel in one direction at a time
- Terminators needed at each end to prevent signal reflection
- Bandwidth limitations (if all computers need to communicate on one line)
- Not secure network as each packet travels through every single node
- If main cable fails, network goes down
