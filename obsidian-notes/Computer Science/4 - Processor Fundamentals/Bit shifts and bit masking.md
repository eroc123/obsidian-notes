#### Logical shift
- bits are shifted out of the register and replaced with 0

#### Cyclic shift
- bits are shifted out of one end of the register and replaced at the other end

#### Arithmetic Shift
- Used on signed bits, the sign is preserved
- The leftmost bit (the one that determines the sign) stays in place, whilst the rest of the bits get moved using a cyclic shift.
