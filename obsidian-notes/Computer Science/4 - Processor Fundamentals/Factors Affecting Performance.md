**Clock speed:** 
- The number of processor cycles that happen within a given time period
- e.g. 3.2 GHz means 3.2 billion cycles per second
**Bus width:**
- The number of sub wires in a bus and determines the maximum length of the address line that a computer can use. e.g. if there are 32 sub wires then the maximum address line can be 32 bits.
**Number of cores:**
- Having more cores allows more tasks to be executed simultaneously (since you have multiple cores working on multiple tasks)
**Cache memory:**
- The more cache, the more instructions can be queued and carried out/
