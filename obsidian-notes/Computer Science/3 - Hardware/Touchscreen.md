# Resistive touch screen
 ![[Pasted image 20230928105823.png]]
- Cheaper, more robust due to use of plastic in construction
- Can be used with gloves
- Not as touch sensitive
- Worse colours

**How it works:**
- Has an upper layer of plastic and a bottom layer of glass with electrodes attached to each of them
- When the top layer is touched, the upper layer contacts the bottom layer and completes an electrical circuit
- The X and Y coordinates of the touch location can then be determined.

# Capacitive touch screen

- **Benefits**
- Very touch sensitive
- Has better colour contrast
- Visibility is good even in strong sunlight

- **Drawbacks**
- More expensive and fragile since it uses glass
- Cannot use gloves, although stylus can be used

**How it works:**
- Made up of many glass layers - act like a capacitor creating electric fields between the layers
- When top glass layer is touched, static electrical charge from finger is drawn onto point of contact
- There is change in electrostatic field
- Coordinates of point of contact can be determined
- Coordinates sent to touchscreen driver.
