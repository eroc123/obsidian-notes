- Digital data passed through a DAC (digital to analogue converter) - converted to electric current
- Current is passed through an amplifier
- Current is sent to loudspeaker
- Current passes through a copper coil that is wrapped around an iron core - creating an [[electromagnet]]. 
	- The magnetic field varies with the current strength passing through the coil
- The iron core will be attracted to a [[permanent magnet]] at varying magnitudes (as the magnetic field varies) as the [[current]] passes through the wire, causing the iron core to vibrate.
- Iron core is attached to a cone, which vibrates along with it, creating a sound.
