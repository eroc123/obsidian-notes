- Input devices are needed to send data (in analogue form) from the physical environment or human operators to computers, where the signal can then be processed into a digital form.
	- e.g. sensors, mice, keyboard
- Output devices are needed to send data (in digital form) from a computer to a user to display (in auditory or visual form). Can also be used to control actuators and machines.
	- e.g. actuators, display, headphones
