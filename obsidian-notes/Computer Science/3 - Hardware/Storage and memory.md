Computers require memory and storage in order to function properly. 

**Each device can be classified into one of two groups, whether they are primary memory or secondary storage**

**Primary Memory**: Primary memory can be directly accessed by a computer's CPU. Consists of RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read Only Memory)
- To store instructions needed to boot up the computer
- To store part of the operating system
- To store part of the software in use
- To store intermediate data
- Types of [[RAM]] include:
	- [[DRAM]] (Dynamic Ram)
	- [[SRAM]] (Static Ram)
- Types of ROM include:
	- [[PROM]] (Programmable read-only memory)
	- [[EPROM]] (Erasable programmable read-only memory)
	- [[EEPROM]] (Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory)


**Secondary Storage:** Secondary storage is used to store long term data and has a much larger capacity than memory devices. Are not directly accessable by CPU.
- [[Hard Disk Drive]] (HDD)
- [[Solid State Drive]] (SSD)
- [[Optical Media]], such as CD's, DVD's

**Storage devices can also be classified as internal or external devices**

**Internal storage devices:**
- Devices that are built into the computer such as SSD's or HDD's
**External/removable devices:**
- Devices that can be removed and allows data to be stored seperately from the computer or transported to another location. e.g. [[Optical Media|DVD's, CD's]], [[Solid State Drive|flash drives, external SSD's]]
