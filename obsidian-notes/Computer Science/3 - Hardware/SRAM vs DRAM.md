|                   | SRAM                                       | DRAM                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Speed             | Faster access time                         | Slower access time                   |
| Build             | Transistors only                               | Transistors and capacitors                |
| Refresh rate      | No need to refresh                                      | Higher - else capacitors leak charge |
| Memory capacity   | Lower - stores less data per unit volume                                      | Higher - stores more data per unit volume - transistor-capacitor pair is smaller than SRAM's 4 transistor group                               |
| Usage             | Memory cache - it requires very high speed | Main memory - has more storage and data doesn't require as fast access                          |
| Power consumption | Higher than DRAM when under heavy load     | Generally higher during average load |
| Cost              | More expensive                             | Less expensive                       |
