**Description of what happens once a file has been sent to printer:**
- Sheet of paper fed into printer. Sensor detects whether paper is avaliable in the feed tray. If it has run out of paper, error is sent back to the computer. If there is a jam, an error is sent back to computer.
- Sheet of paper is fed through the printer, print head moves from side to side and sprays the four ink colours in exact amounts to produce desired colour in desired spot.
- Paper is advanced slightly when the print head has done one cycle side to side.
- Repeats until the entire page in the printer buffer has been printed out.
- Once buffer is empty, printer requests more data from computer. Repeats until entire document has been printed.
