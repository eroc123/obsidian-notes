**Description of what happens once a file has been sent to printer:**
- File gets stored in a temporary memory called a printer buffer
- Printing drum gets given a positive charge. As drum rotates, laser modifies the charge of certain areas to become negative. Pattern of negative and positive matches text or image that is going to be printed.
- Drum is coated with positively charged toner. Sticks to negative areas of the drum but not to positive parts.
- Negatively charged sheet of paper is run over the drum.
	- Toner on drum sticks to negatively charged paper, create exact replica of the image on the drum.
- Paper goes through fuser which melts toner - the ink then sticks permanently onto the paper.
- Discharge lamp removes charge - ready to print next page.
