**Monitor systems:**
- Monitors data from the environment using sensors and sends it a computer
- Data converted from analogue to digital (ADC)
- Computer compares it with set value.
- If new data is outside acceptable range, send warning message
- Does not alter the environment
- e.g. hospital monitor

**Control systems:**
- Monitors data from the environment using sensors and sends it to a computer
- Data converted from analogue to digital (ADC)
- Computer compares it with set value
- If new data is outside acceptable range, microprocessor sends signals to control values - microprocessor can control actuators to do this
- Output from system affects next set of inputs.
- e.g. air-conditioning
