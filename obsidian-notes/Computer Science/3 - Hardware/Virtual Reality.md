- Video is sent from computer to headset
- Two feeds are sent to an LCD/OLED display, one for left eye, one for right eye.
	- Video can be reshaped for each display to give a realistic visual effect
- When user moves their head, sensors measure this movement and allows the video on the screen to react to the user's head movements
- Headsets use binaural sound (surround sound) so that [[speaker]] can appear to come from a certain direction relative to the user, making it sound more realistic.
