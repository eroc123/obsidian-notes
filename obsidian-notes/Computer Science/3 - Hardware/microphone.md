**When sound is picked up:**
- Converts accoustic energy into electrical energy
- Sound waves propagate through the air
- The microphone diaphragm (a thin piece of material) also vibrates along with the air at the same frequency
- Copper coil is wrapped around permanent magnet and copper coil is connected to diaphragm using a cone. Vibration of diaphragm also cause copper coil to vibrate in and out and induce electric current.
- Electric current is amplified and sent to a recording device and is analogue in nature.
	- Can also be sent to a computer, where a sound board converts the analogue signal (using an ADC - analogue to digital converted) into a digital signal.
