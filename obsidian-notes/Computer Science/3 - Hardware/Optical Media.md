- Uses laser light to read and write data.
- Include devices such as:
	- CD
		- Smallest storage device, holds 0.7 GB
		- Uses infrared (750nm) - least number of pits and bumps out of all optical storage
	- DVD
		- 4.7 GB storage
		- Uses shorter wavelength red laser (650nm) - allows more pits and bumps to fit on surface than CD
		- Used to supply movies or video games
	- Blu-ray
		- Highest capacity, holds 25 GB
		- Uses blue laser (405nm) - allows most pits and bumps to fit on the surface
		- Used to supply movies or video games
	- **Second way to categorize optical media:**
	- R:
		- Recordable
		- Can be written to once, and then it becomes a ROM disc- read only
	- ROM:
		- Read only memory
		- Disc cannot be written to - intended as read only
	- RW:
		- Rewritable
		- Data can be written or erased from the disc multiple times
		- Deteriorates after many read write cycles.
**Arrangement:**
- Uses a single spiral which runs out from the center to the edge of the disc
- Divided into sectors
- Has pits and lands which record 0's and 1's respectively
- Lands are reflective whilst pits are not reflective
**Reading data:**
- The disc spins at a very high speed 
	- Laser light is focused by the optic disk reader lens to read the data. 
- When the laser emitting diode is shone onto lands, it gets reflected. The reflected light is detected by a photoelectric sensor and encodes the data as ones.
- When the laser emitting diode is shone onto pits, it is not reflected. The absence of reflected light detected by the photoelectric sensor is encoded as 0's.
