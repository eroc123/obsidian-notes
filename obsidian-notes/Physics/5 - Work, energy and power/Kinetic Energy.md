$KE = 1/2mv^2$
- where m is in kg,
- v is in $ms^-1$
- KE is in J
**Energy is a scalar**

- An object will maintain its kinetic energy if speed stays constant
- An object's kinetic energy will increase/decrease if its speed increases/decreases respectively.

- Use SUVAT, $F=ma$, $W=Fs$, $v^2=u^2+2as$
