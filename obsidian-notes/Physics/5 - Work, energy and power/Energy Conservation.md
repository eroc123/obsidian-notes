**Principle of Conservation of energy states:** Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, it can only change from one form to another.
- Total energy in a system remains constant, but the various forms the energy takes can vary


#### Energy dissipation
- When energy is transferred from one form to another, not all energy is transformed into intended form
	- e.g. a light bulb transforms [[electrical energy]] to [[Photon|light energy]] but a lot of the electrical energy is converted to heat instead.
- Dissipated energy is wasted as it is lost to surroundings - **wasted energy**
