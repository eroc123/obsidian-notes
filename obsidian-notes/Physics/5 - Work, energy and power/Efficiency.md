$Efficiency = {Useful Energy Output}/{TotalEnergyInput}$
- multiply by 100 to get a percentage
- exact formula can also be used with power

- Efficiency just measures the proportion of the inputted energy that actually gets converted to the desired energy form. 
	- e.g. an efficiency of 75% in the case of a light bulb means that 75% of the electrical energy that gets input into the lightbulb gets converted to light.
