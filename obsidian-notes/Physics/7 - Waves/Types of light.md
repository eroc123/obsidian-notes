**Natural sunlight or light from a lamp** contains the full spectrum of colours. These can be used as mostly monochromatic light when passed through a coloured filter. 

e.g. passing through green filter to get mostly green monochromatic light

**Vapour lamps and discharge tubes** produces light with a dominate colour, so they are mostly monochromatic

**Lasers** produces highly monochromatic light within 1 nm. The colour produced will depend upon the composition of the laser.

The light is very parallel  and can be readily focused to a concentrated spot with a very small area

light is coherent as the emission of photons is not random
