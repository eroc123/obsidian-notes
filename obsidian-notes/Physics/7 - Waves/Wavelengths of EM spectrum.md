In the electromagnetic spectrum certain portions are given special names. 

You need to be able to recall roughly the ranges for each type of the EM spectrum

| Name           | Wavelength                          | Uses                                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Radio waves    | 100 m - 50 cm                       | telecommunication                       |
| Microwaves     | 30 cm to 0.3 mm | vibrate water particle, WiFi/phone call |
| Infrared Waves | 25 μm - 2.5 μm                      | Transmit heat                           |
| Visible light  | 750 nm - 400 nm                     | Light we can see                        |
| Ultra violet   | 400 nm - 1 nm                       | Sun tan, star formation                 |
| X-Rays         | 1 nm - 1 pm                         | Doesn't pass though dense material      |
| Gamma Rays     | < $10^{-12}$ m                      |      Kill cancer cell                                   |
