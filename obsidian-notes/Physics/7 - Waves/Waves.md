#### Types of waves
- **Mechanical Waves:**
	- Require medium to travel through - for vibrations to be transmitted through
		- Such as sound, water
- **Electromagnetic Waves:**
	- Vibrating electromagnetic fields that do not require a medium to travel through - can travel through vacuum
		- Such as light, radio

- Waves transfer two things: **Energy** and **Information**
