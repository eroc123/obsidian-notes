- **ONLY APPLIES TO TRANSVERSE WAVES**
- Transverse waves from e.g. a light source are travelling with vibrations in all planes perpendicular to the propagation direction (direction of travel)

- Can be polarized, meaning that vibrations are restricted to **one** direction
![[Unpolarized light]] Unpolarized light
![[Polarized light]] Polarized light

Unpolarized light (or other transverse waves) can be passed through a polarizing filter which only allows oscillations in certain planes to be allowed

If polarized light is passed through a filter with a transmission axis rotated 90 degrees compared to the direction of vibration, no light passes through.

Use of polarizing filter: Polarizing glasses, reduce glare and allows fishermen to see underwater.

#### Malus's law 

$I=I_0cos^2\theta$   
where I is intensity of a **polarized** wave after it gets transmitted through another polarizing filter. (unpolarized not required as per syllabus)

when $\theta$ is 90, the intensity of the polarized wave is 0.
