**Phase difference:** Given point on one wave lags behind the exact same point on another wave (if the two waves are of the same frequency)

When the crests and troughs of two waves are aligned, they are **in phase** (0 radians or $2\pi$ radians distance)
When the crests of one waves aligns with the trough of another, they are **in antiphase** ($\pi$ radians distance)

Expressed in angle in either degrees or radians (1 whole cycle is $360Â°$ or $2\pi ^r$ )

**Formula**
$2 \pi d/\lambda$ = Phase difference (in radians)
- **Applies only to waves of**
	- Same frequency
	- Same wavelength

If phase difference is $\pi$, it is called **antiphase.**
