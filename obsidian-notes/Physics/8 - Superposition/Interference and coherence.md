Interference occurs when two waves of the type overlap and [[superposition|cause the displacements of the two waves to add together]].

**Coherence:** When two waves have the same frequency and constant phase difference.


**Light example**
- If two waves are coherent, it will produce a noticeable pattern. Usually a more sharp image.
- If two waves are incoherent, then there will be no observable pattern and have a more diffuse/washed out appearance.
