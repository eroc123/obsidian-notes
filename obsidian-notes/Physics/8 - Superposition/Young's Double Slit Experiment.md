![[Young's double slit experiment.png]]
- Light from a monochromatic source (same wavelength) is diffracted through a single slit
- When the light hits the double slit, it essentially creates two light sources at A and B. Since the light at A and B comes from the same source, they are also coherent, allowing [[Interference and coherence]] pattern to be seen.
- Dark and bright interference pattern created.
