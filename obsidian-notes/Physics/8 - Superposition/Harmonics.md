- Simplest [[Stationary Wave Formation|standing waves]] consists of a single loop, with each [[Stationary Wave Formation#^5d7323|node]] at each fixed end and an [[Stationary Wave Formation#^70d539|antinode]] in the middle.

- **Fundamental mode of vibration**
- Distance between nodes has to be  $1/2\lambda$ (half the [[wavelength]] of the [[wave]])
- Fundamental frequency $f_0$ is the lowest [[frequency]] at which a standing wave appears
	- $\lambda_0 = 2L$ (fundamental wavelength is $\lambda_0$
	- where L is length of string
	- frequency: $f=c/2L$ (since $\lambda = 2L$ )
	- Node on each end is $1/2 \lambda$

When the frequency is increased, higher harmonics start to appear.
