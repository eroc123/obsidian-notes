- **Diffraction Grating:** a plate on which there is a very large number of parallel, identical, close-spaced slits
	- When monochromatic light passed through, pattern of narrow bright fringes produced on screen

- The central beam is referred to as the "zero order beam"
- The other beams are numbered outwards on each side: 1st order 2nd order etc.

- The angle of diffraction between each beam and the zero order beam increases with increasing wavelength

- The angle of diffraction between each beam and the zero order beam increases with decreasing slit distance

For waves of the first order, the wave from the previous cycle reinforces with the current cycle at P, causing a new wavefront. 

2nd order means the wave 2 cycles ago is reinforcing the current cycle, and so on.
### Explanation & derivation
- Formation of the nth order
- Wavefront at P reinforces wavefront at Q emitted n cycles earlier
- Wavefront from Q has travelled n wavelengths
	$n$ = order
	$QY$ is $n\lambda$
	$sin \theta = {QY \over QP}$
	$sin \theta = {n \lambda \over d }$

**Formula:**
$dsin\theta = n \lambda$

The number of slits per meter N is 1/d

As d decreases the angle of diffraction increases (as N increases, the angle of diffraction increases)

The maximum number of orders is when $\theta$ is 90 and hence $sin \theta = 1$

$\therefore n = d/\lambda$
