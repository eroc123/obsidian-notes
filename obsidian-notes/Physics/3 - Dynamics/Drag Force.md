- Forces that act to the opposite direction to an object moving through a fluid such as gas or liquid
	- e.g. air resistance and friction
- The magnitude of drag forces increases as the speed of an object increases.
- If the drag force equals to the force of acceleration, the object will remain at a constant velocity.
