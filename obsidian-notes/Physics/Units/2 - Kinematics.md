1. **Equations of motion**
	1. define and use [[SUVAT equations|distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration]]
	2. use graphical methods to represent distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration  [[SUVAT equations]]
	3. determine displacement from the area under a velocity–time graph [[SUVAT equations]]
	4. determine velocity using the gradient of a [[Displacement time graph|displacement–time graph]]
	5. determine acceleration using the gradient of a [[Physics/Excalidraw/Deriving SUVAT 4|velocity–time graph]]
	6. derive, from the definitions of velocity and acceleration, [[Physics/2 - Kinematics/Deriving SUVAT|equations that represent uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line]] 
	7. [[Projectiles & SUVAT|solve problems using equations]] that represent uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line, including the motion of bodies falling in a uniform gravitational field without air resistance
	8. describe an experiment to determine the acceleration of free fall using a falling object
	9. describe and explain motion due to a uniform velocity in one direction and a uniform acceleration in a perpendicular direction
