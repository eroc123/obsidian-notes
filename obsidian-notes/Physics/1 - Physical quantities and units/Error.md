**Precision:** How close together the measurements are
**Accuracy:** How close to the true data the measurements are
![[Precision and accuracy.png]]
#### Random error
- Fluctuations in readings due to environmental factors - can cause reduction in **precision** and higher spread of values
- Solution: repeat experiment multiple times and average the values out
#### Systematic error
- Due to instrument flaws or methodology flaw
- Error is repeated every time, leading to a reduction in **accuracy**
- Solution: recallibrate instruments or recheck methodology
#### Zero error
- When the true data is 0 but the instrument is giving a reading other than zero - introduces a fixed error that has to be compensated for
