- [[Voltmeter]] always set up in [[Parallel Circuit|parallel]] to the component you are measuring voltage for

- Charges act as energy carriers that can collect energy from the battery.
- As the charge move through the bulb, it has to put in effort in order to do so.
- Bulb is lighting up because of the energy the charge throws into the bulb

Potential difference is the amount of work done per unit charge when moving across 2 points of a circuits
$V = {W \over Q}$ 
W: work done (J)
Q: charge (C)
$1V =$ 1 Juel of work done for every 1 columb of charge
