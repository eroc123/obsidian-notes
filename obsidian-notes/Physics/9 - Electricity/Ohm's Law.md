- For a conductor at a constant temperature (for some conductors), [[Potential difference]] is directly proportional to [[current]]
- For conductors that obey ohm's law, they are called ohmic conductors

$$V \propto I$$
$$V = kI$$
$$\text{Let R} = k$$
$$V = RI$$
$$\text{Therefore R} = {V \over I}$$
For ohmic conductors, R is constant
This rule breaks for no ohmic conductors

Gradient of VI graph is R


Experiment set up:
![[ohms law.png]]
- Fixed Resistor - resistor that always has the same resistance
- Variable resistor - a resistor whose resistance value can be changed

- If a graph of current plotted against potential difference is a straight line through the origin, the electric component is said to obey Ohm's law.
