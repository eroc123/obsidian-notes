- Resistance is the opposition to the current
- The higher the resistance, the lower the current (as it opposes the current)
- Related in the equation $V=IR$
- Measured in ohms ($\Omega$) - defined as one volt per ampere

- Conductors have rows of tightly packed atoms, all of which obstructs the flow of charges
- Resistance is the ratio of [[Potential difference]] and current of a conductor

$R = V/I$ (Formula arrieas from [[Ohm's law]])
V: pd
I: current
R: resistance ($\ohm$)

Factors effecting resistance
- Length
	- Longer length increases resistance
	- $R \propto L$
- Cross-sectional area
	- Greater area decreases resistance
	- $R \propto 1/A$

$$R \propto {L \over A}$$
$$R = k{L \over A}$$
$$\text{Let } \rho = k$$
$$R = \rho {L \over A}$$
Intrinsic property
(Only depend on the type of conductor)
