**Electric current is the flow of charge carriers and is measured in units of amperes (A) or amps**

- Can either be negative or positive
- Conventional current goes in the direction from the positive terminal to the negative terminal
- Electrons flow from the negative terminal to positive terminal
- Conventional current is opposite direction to electron flow

#### Use of ammeters
- Ammeters is connected in series to a circuit
- Think of it being a sensor within a water pipe to measure the current of the pipe - the water must pass through

#### Quantisation of Charge
- One electron has one negative charge
- One proton has one positive charge
- Dependent on how many electrons/protons there are, meaning that there is a definite minimum magnitude, with all higher charges coming in multiples of that magnitude
- One electron/proton has a charge of $1.60 * 10^{-19}C$ denoted with e
