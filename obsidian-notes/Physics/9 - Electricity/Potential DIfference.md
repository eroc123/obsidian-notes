- Potential difference across a component is defined as **energy transferred per unit charge flowing from one point to another**
- Measured in $V$ ($JC^{-1}$) Joules per coulomb
	- Essentially measures the amount of energy transferred per unit charge
	- e.g. a light bulb with a voltage of 3$V$ will mean that every coulomb of charge passing through will lose 3$J$ of energy
	- $V = W/Q$
- Potential difference of a power supply connected in [[Series Circuit|series]] is shared between all components in the circuit
