At constant T, it gives a straight line

The higher T is, the greater the gradient of the line as the resistance falls with increasing T

- Resistance changes depending on temperature
- As temperature increases, the resistance of a thermistor decreases 
![[Thermistor.png]]
- Used in temperature sensors and used in circuits in ovens, fire alarms and digital thermometsrs.
	- As thermistor gets hotter, resistance decreases
	- As thermistor gets cooler, resistance increases
