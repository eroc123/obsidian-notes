- A **center of gravity** of a body is the point through which a single force on a the body has no turning effect
	- Basically if you apply a force here then the body won't turn.
- **Center of mass** is the point where all distributed mass in a body is concentrated.
	- Since its a hypothetical point, it can be located outside of a body and doesn't need to be in a physical material. e.g. hollow tennis ball, center of gravity located in the hollow center.
##### Stability: 
- An object will remain stable if the center of gravity is directly above its base
- The wider the base, the more stable the object
- The lower the center of gravity, the more stable the object (you have to tilt the object farther to topple it)

![[Center of gravity|100%]] 

- In a uniform gravitational field, center of mass = center of gravity
- Center of gravity does depend on gravitational field, whilst center of mass does not.
- For example, an object in space will have a center of gravity that is closer towards a large body with a large gravitational field compared to its center of mass.

- Support forces $S = W_1 + W_0 + W_2$ (The force that acts on the pivot or fulcrum.)
	- where $W_0$ is the weight of the body, and $W_1, W_2$ are the weights of the masses.
	- Support forces act on the center of mass, as there is no turning effect there.
