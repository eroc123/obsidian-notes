- Defined as **mass per unit volume**.
	- if mass is measured in g (grams) and vol in $cm^3$ then density is in $g/cm^3$
	- if mass is measured in kg (kilograms) and vol in $m^3$ then density is in $kg/m^3$
- Volume of object can be calculated with math

density of water is $1000kg/m^3$ at $4 \degree C$

When water freezes and turns into ice it expands. Expansion means increase in volume with same mass, therefore density decreases. Density is below water and floats.
