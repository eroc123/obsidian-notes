**Archimedes' Principle**
- The buoyant force acting on an object fully or partially submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.


- e.g. If 5 kg of water is displaced, that means the weight of the water is 50N. According to Archimedes Principle, this means that the buoyant force is 50N.
- The volume of fluid displayed is equivalent to the volume of a non-porus object when fully submerged.
