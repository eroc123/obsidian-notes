- Very low limit of proportionality
- Very elastic
- Curled when unstretched
- Uncurled when stretched
- Curling/uncurling is different.

![[Rubber]]
- Region A + B - area bounded by the blue line and x axis - is the total work done in stretching the rubber band. ($N*m = Nm$ = work done)
- Region A = area bounded by blue and red line - work done heating the rubber
- Region B = area bounded by red line and x axis - the work done by the rubber when it returns to its original size.
