**Elasticity:** The ability of a soild to regain its shape after it has been deformed or distorted

**Tensile:** Deformation due to stretching

**Compressive deformation:** Deformation due to compression

**Ductile:** The ability to be drawn into a wire. Ductile materials have a very large plastic region. Just before it fails, the material necks.

**Brittle:** Material breaks without any "give". Cannot be permanently stretched. Show little, if any plastic deformation. Usually have very sudden and catastrophic failiures. Better under compression.
	e.g. glass
**Elastic limit:** Maximum amount a material can be stretched by a force and still return to its original shape and size. (max point without getting deformed)

**Yield point:** Beyond the elastic limit, a point is reached at which there is a noticeably larger permanent change in length. Results in plastic behavior

**Ultimate Tensile strength:** Maximum stress that can be applied without breaking.

**Plasticity:** Does not return to its original size and shape when the force is removed, there is a permanent stretching and change of shape.

**Stiffness:** A measure of how difficult it is to change the size or shape of a material.
