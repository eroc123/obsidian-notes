Stress strain curve:
1. Linear region where Hookes law is obeyed
2. Limit of proportionality - hookes law is no longer obeyed
3. Elastic limit - point where material stops returning to its original length
4. Yield point where the material 'necks'
5. Ultimate tensile stress (U.T.S) - maximum stress a material can take before it breaks
6. Breaking point, can occur at any point after ultimate tensile stress
