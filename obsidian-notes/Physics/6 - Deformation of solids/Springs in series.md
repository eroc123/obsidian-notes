If there are two springs in series holding the same [[mass]], then the formula would be $\Delta L=W/k_p + W/k_q$ where W is the total weight of the load, $k_p$ and $k_q$ is the spring constants of each spring and $\Delta L$ is the change in extension of both springs in total.

This is because the force held by the two springs (as both springs are holding the same load) combined will equal to the weight of the load. $F_p + F_q = W$
- $\Delta L$ is the total extension of both sprints. $\Delta L_q + \Delta L_p = \Delta L$
- Substitute in the two formulas for [[hooke's law]] and you get to the formula $\Delta L=W/k_p + W/k_q$ (rearrange $\Delta L_q/k_q=F_q$ to get $L_q=W/k_q$)
- rearrange to get $\Delta L/W=1/k_p + 1/k_q$
- $1/k_p + 1/k_q = 1/k$
