- Normally materials have some resistance.
- When current flows through them they heat up.
- But superconductors can be cooled below a transition temperature below which the\ resistivity disappears.
- This means no energy is lost as heat energy.
- For metals the transition temp is about 10K (-263 C).

### Uses
- Power cables that can transmit electricity with no loss of energy
- Really strong electromagnets that don't need a constant power source (e.g. Maglev trains).
- Electronic circuits that work really fast.
