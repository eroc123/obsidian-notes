1. **Energy conservation**
	1. understand the [[Work Done|concept of work]], and recall and use work done = force Ã— displacement in the direction of the force
	2. recall and apply the principle of [[Energy Conservation|conservation of energy]]
	3. recall and understand that the [[Efficiency]] of a system is the ratio of useful energy output from the system to the total energy input
	4. use the concept of efficiency to solve problems
	5. define [[Excalidraw/Power]] as work done per unit time
	6. solve problems using P = W / t
	7. [[Derive P = Fv]] and use it to solve problems
2. **Gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy**
	1. derive, using $W = Fs$, the formula $\Delta EP = mg\Delta h$ for [[Gravitational potential energy|gravitational potential energy]] changes in a uniform gravitational field
	2. recall and use the formula $\Delta EP = mg\Delta h$ for gravitational potential energy changes in a uniform gravitational field
	3. derive, using the equations of motion, the formula for [[Physics/5 - Work, energy and power/Kinetic energy|kinetic energy]] $E_K = {1\over2}mv^2$ 
	4. recall and use $E_K = {1\over2}mv^2$
