1. Stress and strain
	1. understand that deformation is caused by tensile or compressive forces (forces and deformations will be assumed to be in one dimension only) 
	2. understand and use the terms load, extension, compression and limit of proportionality 
	3. recall and use Hookeâ€™s law 
	4. recall and use the formula for the spring constant k = F/ x 
	5. define and use the terms stress, strain and the Young modulus 
	6. describe an experiment to determine the Young modulus of a metal in the form of a wire
2. Elastic and plastic behaviour
	1. understand and use the terms elastic deformation and elastic limit
	2. understand that the area under the force-extension graph represents the work done
	3. determine the elastic potential energy of a material deformed within its limit of proportionality from the area under the force-extension graph
	4. recall and use $E_p = {1 \over 2}Fx = {1 \over 2} kx^2$ for a material deformed within its limit of proportionality
