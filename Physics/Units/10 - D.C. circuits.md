1. [[Practical circuits]]
	1. recall and use the circuit symbols shown in section 6 of this syllabus
	2. draw and interpret circuit diagrams containing the circuit symbols shown in section 6 of this syllabus
	3. define and use the electromotive force (e.m.f.) of a source as energy transferred per unit charge in driving charge around a complete circuit
	4. distinguish between [[Electromotive Force|e.m.f]] and potential difference (p.d.) in terms of energy considerations
	5. understand the effects of the [[internal resistance]] of a source of e.m.f. on the terminal potential difference
2. Kirchhoff’s laws
	1. recall [[Kirchoff's First Law]] and understand that it is a consequence of conservation of charge
	2. recall [[Kirchoff's Second Law]] and understand that it is a consequence of conservation of energy
	3. derive, using Kirchhoff’s laws, a formula for the combined resistance of two or more resistors in series
	4. use the formula for the combined resistance of two or more resistors in series
	5. derive, using Kirchhoff’s laws, a formula for the combined resistance of two or more resistors in parallel
	6. use the formula for the combined resistance of two or more resistors in parallel
	7. use Kirchhoff’s laws to solve simple circuit problems
3. Potential dividers
	1. understand the principle of a potential divider circuit
	2. recall and use the principle of the potentiometer as a means of comparing potential differences
	3. understand the use of a galvanometer in null methods
	4. explain the use of thermistors and light-dependent resistors in potential dividers to provide a potential difference that is dependent on temperature and light intensity
