1. [[Stationary Wave Formation|Stationary Waves]]
	1. explain and use the principle of [[superposition]]
	2. show an understanding of experiments that demonstrate [[Stationary or standing wave|stationary waves]] using [[Electromagnetic Waves|microwaves]], stretched strings and air columns (it will be assumed that end corrections are negligible; knowledge of the concept of end corrections is not required)
	3. explain the [[Stationary Wave Formation|formation of a stationary]] wave using a graphical method, and identify [[node|nodes and antinodes]]
	4. understand how wavelength may be determined from the positions of nodes or antinodes of a stationary wave
2. [[Diffraction]]
	1. explain the meaning of the term diffraction
	2. show an understanding of experiments that demonstrate diffraction including the qualitative effect of the gap width relative to the wavelength of the wave; for example diffraction of water waves in a ripple tank
3. [[Interference and coherence|Interference]]
	1. understand the terms interference and coherence
	2. show an understanding of experiments that demonstrate two-source interference using water waves in a ripple tank, sound, light and microwaves
	3. understand the conditions required if [[Two Source Interference|two-source interference]] fringes are to be observed
	4. recall and use λ = ax / D for double-slit interference using light
4. The diffraction grating
	1. recall and use d sin θ = nλ
	2. describe the use of a diffraction grating to determine the wavelength of light (the structure and use of the spectrometer are not included)
