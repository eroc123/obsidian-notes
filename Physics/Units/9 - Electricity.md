1. Electric current 
	1. understand that an electric current is a flow of charge carriers 
	2. understand that the charge on charge carriers is quantised 
	3. recall and use Q = It 
	4. use, for a current-carrying conductor, the expression I = Anvq, where n is the number density of charge carriers 
2. Potential difference and power Candidates should be able to: 
	1. define the potential difference across a component as the energy transferred per unit charge 
	2. recall and use V = W/Q 
	3. recall and use P = VI, P = I 2 R and P = V2 /R 
3. Resistance and resistivity 
	1. define resistance 
	2. recall and use V = IR 
	3. sketch the I–V characteristics of a metallic conductor at constant temperature, a semiconductor diode and a filament lamp 
	4. explain that the resistance of a filament lamp increases as current increases because its temperature increases 
	5. state Ohm’s law 
	6. recall and use R = ρL /A 
	7. understand that the resistance of a light-dependent resistor (LDR) decreases as the light intensity increases 
	8. understand that the resistance of a thermistor decreases as the temperature increases (it will be assumed that thermistors have a negative temperature coefficient)
