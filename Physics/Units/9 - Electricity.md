1. Electric current 
	1. understand that an [[electric current]] is a flow of charge carriers 
	2. understand that the charge on charge carriers is quantised 
	3. recall and use Q = It 
	4. use, for a current-carrying conductor, the expression I = Anvq, where n is the number density of charge carriers 
2. [[Potential difference]] and [[power]] 
	1. define the potential difference across a component as the energy transferred per unit charge 
	2. recall and use V = W/Q 
	3. recall and use P = VI, P = I^2 R and P = V^2/R 
3. [[Resistance]] and [[resistivity]] 
	1. define resistance 
	2. recall and use V = IR 
	3. sketch the [[I-V Characteristics of Different Components|I-V Characteristics]] of a metallic conductor at constant temperature, a semiconductor diode and a [[filament bulb]] 
	4. explain that the resistance of a filament lamp increases as current increases because its temperature increases 
	5. state [[Ohm's Law]] 
	6. recall and use R = ρL /A 
	7. understand that the resistance of a [[Sensory Resistors|light-dependent resistor]] (LDR) decreases as the light intensity increases 
	8. understand that the resistance of a [[thermistor]] decreases as the temperature increases (it will be assumed that thermistors have a negative temperature coefficient)
