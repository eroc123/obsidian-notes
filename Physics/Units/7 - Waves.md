1. Progressive waves 
	1. describe what is meant by wave motion as illustrated by vibration in ropes, springs and ripple tanks 
	2. understand and use the terms [[displacement]], [[amplitude]], [[phase difference]], period, [[frequency]], [[wavelength]] and speed 
	3. understand the use of the time-base and y-gain of a [[Cathode-ray Oscilliscope]] (CRO) to determine frequency and amplitude 
	4. derive, using the definitions of speed, frequency and wavelength, the wave equation v = f λ 
	5. recall and use [[Wave formula derivation|v = f λ ]]
	6. understand that energy is transferred by a progressive wave
	7. recall and use [[Intensity (progressive waves)]] = power/area and intensity ∝ (amplitude)^2 for a progressive wave 
2. [[Transverse Waves]] and [[longitudinal waves]] 
	1. compare transverse and longitudinal waves 
	2. analyze and interpret graphical representations of transverse and longitudinal waves 
3. [[Doppler effect]] for [[Doppler effect - sound waves|sound waves]]
	1. understand that when a source of sound waves moves relative to a stationary observer, the observed frequency is different from the source frequency (understanding of the Doppler effect for a stationary source and a moving observer is not required) 
	2. use the expression $f_ο = f_sv /(v ± v_s)$ for the observed frequency when a source of sound waves moves relative to a stationary observer 
4. [[Electromagnetic Waves|Electromagnetic Spectrum]] 
	1. state that all electromagnetic waves are transverse waves that travel with the same speed c in free space 
	2. recall the approximate range of wavelengths in free space of the principal regions of the electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to γ-rays 
	3. recall that wavelengths in the range 400–700nm in free space are visible to the human eye 
5. [[Polarization]] 
	1. understand that polarisation is a phenomenon associated with transverse waves 
	2. recall and use Malus’s law ($I = I_0 cos^2 θ$) to calculate the intensity of a plane polarised electromagnetic wave after transmission through a polarising filter or a series of polarising filters
