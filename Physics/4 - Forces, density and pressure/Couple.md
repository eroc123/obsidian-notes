- Pair of forces acting to create rotation
![[Physics/Excalidraw/Couple|100%]]
- The forces (N) have to be equal in magnitude
- Opposite in direction
- Perpendicular to the distance between them
- Resultant force of 0, object does not accelerate but it does turn (according to [[Newton's Second law|F=ma]])
- Distance is not 0
- Creates rotation without a pivot
