![[Hydrostatic Pressure|40%]]
The pressure on area $A$ is due to the weight of the column of water $h$ above it
$$ P ={F \over A}$$

Force is the weight of the column $$F = mg$$
Mass of the column is from $$m = \rho \times V$$
Where $$V = A \times h$$
Substitute volume, mass equals $$m = p \times A \times h$$
Weight of the column is now $$F = \rho \times A \times h \times g$$
Substitute back into pressure equation $$P = {\rho \times A \times h \times g \over A} $$ A cancels out,$$P = \rho hg $$
More specifically, the change in pressure $P$ is proportional to the change in height $h$
$$\Delta P = \rho g\Delta h$$
