$Upthrust = \rho gh$
$Upthrust = W$
[[Archimedes Principle]]

- Is a force which pushes up on an object in fluids (liquids, gases)
- Caused due to difference in hydrostatic force at the top and bottom of the submerged object.

- Water pressure at the bottom of an object is higher than at the top due to greater depth.


- Objects appear to weigh less when immersed - due to force of upthrust
$Apparent weight = Actual weight - Upthrust$

![[Excalidraw/Weight]]

If $upthrust > Weight_{object}$ , object floats
If $upthrust = Weight_{object}$ , object is in equilibrium and stays suspended in water
If $upthrust < Weight_{object}$ , object sinks
