Force excreted normally per unit area
normally - Perpendicular to the surface

$Pressure = {F \over a}$
- Pressure is a scalar
- Force either in $N/m^2$ or $N/cm^2$
- 1 $N/m^2$ = 1 pascal

**If area is less, then pressure is higher, if area is more, then pressure is lower.**
- This means that if you wear high heels (low area, high pressure) in the snow, you will most likely sink but if you wear snow shoes then you won't sink (high area, low pressure)

**Pascals Principle:** Any change in the pressure of a fluid is transmitted uniformly in all directions throughout the fluid. Must be a closed system.
