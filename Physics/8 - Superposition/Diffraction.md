**Diffraction** is the spreading of waves when they pass through a gap, past an edge or around a corner

- Diffraction is most prominent when the width of the slit is approximately equal to the wavelength
- Applies to **any** type of wave

### Single slit

A single slit causes an [[Interference and coherence]] pattern as most of the light photons travel straight though the middle of the gap, and loses less energy. However, the photons towards the edge gets diffracted by the gap, causing them to spread out. This alone doesn't cause the fringes, but as the photons diffract, they get diffracted by the other photons next to them, therefore causing the fringes.

A bright fringe occurs at P if  $S_2 P - S_1 P = n \lambda$
For waves to be in phase and constructively interfere, the differnce in the distances travelled by the waves must be a whole number of the wavelength

A dark fringe occures if $S_2P - S_1 P = n \lambda + 1/2 \lambda$
For waves to be out of phase and destructively interfere, the difference in the distances travelled by the waves must be exactly half a wavelength or $1 {1 \over 2}$ or

$$\Delta(phase) = {2 \pi \Delta(path) \over \lambda}$$
(in radians)
OR
$$\Delta(phase) = {360 \Delta(path) \over \lambda}$$
(in degrees)

The wave that has travelled the furthest will have lost more energy, so will have a slightly smaller amplitude than the other. The waves will then not completely cancel each other out

If a wave is reflected off a surface it will have a 180 degree phase change which must be taken into consideration
