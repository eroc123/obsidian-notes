**Conditions:**
- [[Interference and coherence|Coherence]] (constant phase difference)
- Monochromatic (single wavelength)

- When two waves interfere, the resultant wave depends on the **phase difference** between the two waves.
- **phase differenece** is proportional to the **path difference** - the extra distance one wave from one slit has to travel comparted to another wave from the other slit before interefering.

**Path difference formulas:**

d (path difference) can be calculated by finding the difference between $s_1$ path distance and $s_2$ path distance
- $d=n\lambda$ where d is the path difference **IF** the waves are doing constructive interference
- $d=(n+1/2)\lambda$ where d is the path difference **IF** the waves are doing destructive interference

n is the order of the maxima/minima, with n=0 taken at the center
at n=1, the path difference is $1\lambda$, at n=2, the path difference is $2\lambda$ and respectively.
