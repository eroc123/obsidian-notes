#### Terminology
**Node:** Points where wave cancel out and there is no displacement ^5d7323

**Antinode:** Points where wave interferes constructively is called an antinode ^70d539

**Standing wave formation:** 
1. When a crest of a wave on a string arrives at the far end it reverses phase and is reflected, returning as a trough
2. When it once again reaches the vibrator, it reflects, changes phase and once again becomes a crest
3. Further reinforced by a new crest leaving the vibrator, then the amplitude is increased due to interference
4. Standing wave formed

**Description**
- As an incident wave is sent forward, it overlaps/interferes with the reflected wave repeatedly, giving rise to constructive and destructive interference alternatively.
- Constructive interference and destructive interferences happening repeatedly due to changing phase difference as one wave is moving forwards and other other is reflected back.

**Properties**
- Node does not move
- Antinodes only move vertically (they don't shift on the string)
- ![[harmonics 2.png]]
- Simplest [[Harmonics and fundamental frequency|standing wave pattern]] is made up of one antinode and 2 nodes ($1/2\lambda$)

Standing waves applied to (according to syllabus):
- Air columns (distance between speaker and material that can reflect sound minimum $1/2\lambda$)
- Microwaves
- Wave on string
