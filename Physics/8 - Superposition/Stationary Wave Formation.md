#### Terminology
**Node:** Points where wave cancel out and there is no displacement ^5d7323

**Antinode:** Points where wave interferes constructively is called an antinode ^70d539

**Standing wave formation:** 
A stationary wave is formed from the superposition of 2 progressive waves, travelling in opposite directions in the same place, with the same frequency, wavelength and amplitude.

**Properties**
- Node does not move
- Antinodes only move vertically (they don't shift on the string)
- ![[harmonics 2.png]]
- Simplest [[harmonics|standing wave pattern]] is made up of one antinode and 2 nodes ($1/2\lambda$)

Standing waves applied to (according to syllabus):
- Air columns (distance between speaker and material that can reflect sound minimum $1/2\lambda$)
- Microwaves
- Wave on string
