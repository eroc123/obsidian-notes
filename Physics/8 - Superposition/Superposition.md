#### Principle of Superposition

**When two or more [[waves]] meet, the resultant [[displacement]] is the [[Scalar & vector#^d2621e|vector]] sum of the displacements of the individual waves**

**When two or more waves meet, the overall effect depends upon the relative [[amplitude]], [[frequency]] and [[Phase difference|phase]] of the wave.**

#### Process 

- If waves are of the same type, regardless of amplitude or frequency
- If the waves are of the same [[polarisation]]

- If two waves are in **phase**, the relative effect on amplitude increases (the amplitude of the two waves are added)
	- This is because the troughs and crests of both waves line up
	- **Constructive [[Interference and coherence]]**
	

- If two waves are **[[Phase difference|antiphase]]**, the relative effect of the amplitudes get cancelled out. (the amplitude of the waves are subtracted from each other)
	-  **Destructive Interference**
	- This is because the trough from one wave lines up with the crest from another wave.
