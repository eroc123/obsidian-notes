- Formed when two waves with the same frequency and amplitude pass through each other and **[[Superposition|superimpose]]** on each other in a way that the troughs and crests of the wave don't move.
	- Makes it look like the wave is "standing still"
- Formed in a set up when waves produced get reflected off a hard surface and hence the reflected wave interferes with the new waves being produced![[standing wave.jpg]]
