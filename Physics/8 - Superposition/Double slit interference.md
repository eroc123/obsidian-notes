#### In the case of light interference
When two slits are illuminated they produce two coherent sets of waves. These produce a characteristic pattern when they shine onto a white screen.

The pattern is known as **Young's fringes**

In the image: Orange line corresponds to max displacement (since each waves crests and troughs line up with each other). Line created by green points corresponds to min displacement (since each waves crests line up with each waves troughs and hence they cancel each other out)

Representation with light, center is brightest, dark fringes where there is destructive interreference, pattern of dark and light fringes as the observer moves away from the center.

Distance $D$ between the screen & the slits
Wavelength of light $\lambda$
Slit separation $s$

For constructive interference at P the waves must be in phase
$S$

For destructive interference at P the waves must be 180 degrees out of phase

Point Q on like $S_1 P$ is such that $QP = S_2P$
$\therefore$ the path difference is shown by $S_1Q$

The two triangles $S_1S_2Q$ and $MOP$ are similar shapes. The angles $PMO$ are the same and for each triangle the long sides are almost the same length. 

${S_1Q \over S_1S_1} = {OP \over OM}$


Young's experiment confirmed the wave nature of light. Previously Newtons had expressed a view that light was formed from particles

It is easier to measure the centre point of dark fringes rather than light ones

One should measure across several fringes (centre to centre) to reduce errors during measurement

The  wavelength of light will be typically expressed in nanometres. Ensure that all figures are returned to metres for calculations.

The fringe pattern will be closer together if the screen is moved closer
The fringe will be very bright in the middle and fade out very quickly if there is only one slit
