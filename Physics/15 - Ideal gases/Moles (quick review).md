- $Mass/moles = relative atomic mass$
- 1 mole of any substance (e.g. elements/electrons) has exactly $6.02 * 10^{23}$ particles within it.
- e.g. when mass (in grams) of an element equals to its relative atomic mass, you have exactly one mole of that substance. 12 g of carbon 12 is one mole of carbon 12. Meaning there are exactly $6.02 * 10^{23}$ particles.

##### Avogadros constant
- $6.02 * 10^{23} mol^{-1}$
