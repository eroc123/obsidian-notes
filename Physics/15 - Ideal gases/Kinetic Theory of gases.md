##### Brownian motion
- Random motion of larger particles within a fluid caused by the collision of smaller particles surrounding the larger particles. Can be observed under a microscope using smoke particles.
- Evidence proving the existence of molecules and their (random) movement 


##### Kinetic Theory Model

###### Assumptions
- No intermolecular forces between particles
- Duration of collisions is negligable in comparison to time between collisions
- Motion of molecules is random - experience perfectly elastic collisions
- Motion of particles follows newtons laws
- move in straight lines.
