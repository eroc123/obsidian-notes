- Relationship between pressure, temperature and volume for gases
- [[Ideal gases]] follow these laws directly.


##### Boyle's Law - relationship between pressure and volume when temperature is constant

- pV = k
- Higher temp means the curve is further from the origin


##### Charles' Law - relationship between volume and absolute temperature when pressure is constant

- V/T = k


##### The Pressure Law - relationship between pressure and temperature when volume is constant

- p/T = k

- Temperature is in K (kelvin) (conversion is celsius + 273.15)
