- Gases that follow the [[Gas laws]] directly
	- Suggests that the **collisions between gas molecules** are **perfectly elastic** (no kinetic energy lost) and there are **no other interactions**
	- Use the **kelvin scale** in these formulas. Kelvin and celsius are directly proportional with a 1:1 ratio. Just add 273.15 to celsius to get kelvin

- Combine all formulas from the [[Gas laws]] to get:
	- $pV/T = k$ where k depends on the amount of gas used in moles.
	- Can be written as $pV/T = nR$ where n is the number of moles and R is the molar gas constant of $8.31J mol^{-1}K^{-1}$

- $pV = nRT$ is known as the **equation of state for an ideal gas**
