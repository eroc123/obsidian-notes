##### Derivation
- $P=IV$ or $P=I^2 R$ 
- Apply [[Root-mean-square Current & Voltage]] formulas of $I_{r.m.s} = I_0/\sqrt 2$, $P_{mean} = I_0/\sqrt 2 * V_0/\sqrt 2$ , $P_{mean} = I_0 V_0 / 2$  - as you can see mean power is equal to exactly half of both the peak current and peak voltage.
- $P_{peak} = V_0 I_0$ 
##### Conclusion
**The mean power in a resistive load is half the maximum power for a sinusoidal**Â **alternating current or voltage**
