- To produce a steady current from a.c. current, a smoothing capacitor is needed
- **Defined as The reduction in the variation of the output voltage or current**
- One capacitor with capacitance C is connected in parallel with load resistor of resistance R. Capacitor charges up from input voltage and maintains voltage at high level.
- When [[Alternating Current Definition|rectified voltage drops]], the capacitor discharges gradually. When the voltage rises again, the capacitor once again charges

- Result: current $I_{out}$ or voltage $V_{out}$ graph now has a ripple shape.
##### How to ensure that the ripple effect will be smaller
- Use a capacitor with greater capacitance C 
- Resistance with larger resistance R.
- Basically, since the formula for [[Capacitor Discharge Operation|time constant]] is time constant = RC. The goal is to increase the time constant relative to the time interval between the adjacent peaks of the output signal
