- Defined as: A current which periodically varies from positive to negative and changes its magnitude continuously with time
- Direction of alternating current varies every half-cycle
- is sinusodal - electrons in a wire carrying a.c. move back and fourth with [[harmonic motion|simple harmonic motion]] 
	- Time period of alternating current is described as $T = 1/f$
	- T is time period in s f is frequency is in $s^{-1}$
	- Peak current ($I_0$) or peak voltage ($V_0$ ) can be determined from amplitude of the graph, defined as maximum value of alternating current or voltage
- Mains electricity is supplied as alternating current
	- Power stations produce alternating current
	- This is the type of current supplied when devices are plugged into sockets
##### Sinusodal representations
- $I=I_0 sin(\omega t)$
- where $\omega$ is angular frequency ($rads^{-1}$) of the supply
- Similar equation can be used for voltage
