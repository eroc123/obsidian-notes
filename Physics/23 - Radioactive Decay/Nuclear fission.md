- Fission must first be induced by firing neutrons at a nucleus
- When the nucleus is struck by a neutron, it splits into two, or more, daughter nuclei
- During fission, neutrons are ejected from the nucleus, which in turn, can collide with other nuclei which triggers a cascade effect
- This leads to a chain reaction which lasts until all of the material has undergone fission, or the reaction is halted by a moderator
- Nuclear fission is the process which produces energy in nuclear power stations, where it is well controlled
- When nuclear fission is not controlled, the chain reaction can cascade to produce the effects of a nuclear bomb
