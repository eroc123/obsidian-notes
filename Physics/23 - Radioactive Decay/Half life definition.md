- **The time taken for the initial number of nuclei to reduce by half** 
	- when sample size has reduced by half, activity of sample will also decrease by half. Since rate of change of sample size and sample size are $proportional$ to each other, decay can be modelled by $e^x$ as the rate of change of $e^x$ is simply $e^x$ - e suggests that rate of decay and sample size are corrolated and the same.

##### Calculate half life

$N=N_0e^{-\lambda t}$  
- N = number of nuclei remaining in a sample
- N0 = the initial number of undecayed nuclei (when t = 0)
- λ = decay constant (s-1)
- t = time interval (s)

derive: since $N = 1/2 N_0$ (half life), substitute in.

derived equation: $t_{1/2} = ln2/\lambda$ 
- This equation shows that half-life t½ and the radioactive decay rate constant λ are inversely proportional
- Therefore, the shorter the half-life, the larger the decay constant and the **faster** the decay
