- **_The fusing together of two small nuclei to produce a larger nucleus_**
- low mass nuclei e.g. hydrogen and helium can be fused to produce a larger nucleus

- In order for two nuclei to fuse, both nuclei must have high kinetic energy. Protons inside the nuclei are positively charged - means they repel one another
- because of high kinetic energy, it takes a lot of [[obsidian-notes/Physics/Excalidraw/force extension|force]] to overcome electrostatic force. Hence these conditions of extremely high energy can only be found in the sun's core
