- since radioactive decay is [[Random nature of radioactive decay|random and spontaneous]], we need to consider average number of nuclei which will decay per unit time.
	- **Average decay rate**
- each radioactive element can be assigned a decay constant
	- defined as: **the probability that an individual nucleus will decay per unit time**

##### Calculate
- $A = \Delta N/ \Delta t$  = $-\lambda N$
- where A is activity of sample in Becquerels
- ΔN = number of decayed nuclei
- Δt = time interval (s)
- λ = decay constant (s-1)
- N = number of nuclei remaining in a sample
- activity of one Bq is equal to one decay per second

##### What does this show us?
- Greater the decay constant, the greater the activity of the sample
- - The activity depends on the number of undecayed nuclei remaining in the sample
- The minus sign indicates that the number of nuclei remaining decreases with time - however, for calculations it can be omitted
