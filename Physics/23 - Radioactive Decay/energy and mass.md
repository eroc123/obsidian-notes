- $E=mc^2$
- matter can be considered a form of energy - Einstein
- Mass-energy equivalence and can be summarized by the equation:
	- Where
		- E = energy (J)
		- m = mass (kg)
		- c = speed of light ($ms^{-1}$)


- Some examples of mass-energy equivalence are:
    - The **fusion** of hydrogen into helium in the centre of the sun
    - The **fission** of uranium in nuclear power plants
    - Nuclear **weapons**
    - High-energy **particle collisions** in particle accelerators
