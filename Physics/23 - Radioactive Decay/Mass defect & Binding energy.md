- total mass of a nucleus is **less** than the sum of the masses of its constituent nucleons
- difference in mass is known as a **mass defect**
- Defined as: **_The difference between the mass of a nucleus and the sum of the individual masses of its protons and neutrons_**
- equation: $\Delta m = Zm_p + (A-Z)m_n-m_{total}$  
	- Z = proton number
	- A = nucleon number
	- $m_p$ = mass of a proton (kg)
	- $m_n$ = mass of a neutron (kg)
	- $m_{total}$ = measured mass of the nucleus (kg)

- since [[energy and mass]] are equivalent, this suggests that energy is required to break apart a nucleus (since a nucleus has less energy than its constituent parts)
- nuclei are made of both protons and neutrons, protons have [[Magnetic fields|repulsive forces]] since they are all positive (positive repels positive). 
	- Hnece it takes energy to keep the nucleus together, called the **binding energy**
	- Binding energy = **_The energy required to break a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons_**
	- formation of a nucleus from a system of isolated protons and neutrons releases energy - therefore it is exothermic
	- - This can be calculated using the equation:
		- $E=\Delta mc^2$

##### Binding energy per nucleon
- ###### low values of A (low atomic number)
- attractive nuclear forces within atoms dominate over repulsive electrostatic forces by protons.
- right conditions, they can undergo fusion
- during fusion, the mass of the new nuclei is slightly less than the particles which fused. The **mass defect** is equal to **binding energy**
- ###### high vales of A (high atomic number)
- Repuslive electrostatic forces start to dominate nucleus, forces tend to break apart nucleus instead of holding it together
- can undergo fission
- unstable nuclei converted to more stable nuclei with smaller total mass.
- mass is equal to [[Mass defect & Binding energy]] released.

formula: $**E = (Δm)c^2**$
