-  Radioactive decay is both **spontaneous** and **random**
- Spontaneous process defined as:
	- A process that cannot be influenced by environmental factors
- Radioactive decay cannot be influenced by:
	- temperature
	- pressure
	- chemical conditions
- A random process defined as:
	- A process in which the exact time of decay of a nucleus cannot be predicted

- Instead, the nucleus has a constant probability, ie. the same chance, of decaying in a given time

- Therefore, with large numbers of nuclei, it is possible to statistically predict the behaviour of the entire group - we love statistics
