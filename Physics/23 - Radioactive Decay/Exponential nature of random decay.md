- number of nuclei fall very slow, never to 0. this can be illustrated on a graph![[Pasted image 20240830232625.png]]
- activity A is directly proportional to N (number of nuclei) which is proportional to C (count rate)
- $N_0$ = the initial number of undecayed nuclei (when t = 0)
- λ = decay constant (s-1)
- t = time interval (s)

##### Equation
- $N=N_0e^{-\lambda t}$
- where N is number of nuclei left, $N_0$ is initial number of nuclei. $\lambda$ is [[Activity and the decay constant|decay constant]]. $A=\lambda N$ 
- Nuclei can be substituted by activity A. This is because activity is directly proportional to N (number of nuclei). Recieved count rate is related to activity of sample. It can also be represented in exponential form by the equation.
