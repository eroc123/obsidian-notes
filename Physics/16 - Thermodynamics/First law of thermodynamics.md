Describes the **conservation of energy** in a system where energy can be transferred through during work or heating. 

- The first law of thermodynamics states that an **increase in internal energy** of a system is **equal to the sum** of the **energy transferred to it through heating and work done on the system**

- $\Delta U = Q + W$
- $\Delta U$ represents increase (positive) or decrease (negative) in internal energy
- Q is the energy transferred **to** the system through heating
	- If Q is negative then energy is **transferred away** through cooling
- W is the work done **on** the system (when a gas is compressed)
	- If W is negative, then work is being done **by** the system (gas expansion)
