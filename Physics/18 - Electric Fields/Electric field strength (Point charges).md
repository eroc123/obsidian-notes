- Electric field strength E at a distance r due to a point charge Q in free space is defined by:
	- $E = Q/4ε_0 r^2$ 
		- - Q = the charge producing the electric field (C)
		- r = distance from the centre of the charge (m)
		- ε0 = permittivity of free space ($F m^{-1}$)  where F is farad, not force

**Shows that electric field strength around a point charge is not constant**
- Strength of electric field follows inverse square law, where E reduces by a factor of $1/r^2$ as distance r increases.
- Electric field strength is a vector, pointing away from the charge - positive + (positive charge) or towards - negative - (negative charge)
