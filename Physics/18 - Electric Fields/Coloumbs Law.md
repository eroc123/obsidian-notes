- All charged particles produce an electric field around it
	- Field exerts a force on any other charged particle within range
- Electrostatic force between two charges is defined by Coulombs Law
	- Charge of a uniform spherical conductor can be considered a point charge at centre.

- **Law states that:** The electrostatic force between two point charges is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of their separation (1/r^2)
- Equation is $F_E = Q_1 Q_2/4\piÎµ0r^2$  
	- r is distance from the **center of the charges** 
	- hence seperation between particles must be taken from the center of their spheres.
