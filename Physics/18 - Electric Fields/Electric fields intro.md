- think of them being similar to [[Gravitational Field Definition|gravitational fields]] honestly
- **An electric field** is an example of a field of force and is defined as force per unit charge. 
	- (F/q) vs (F/m) for gravity (Force per unit mass)
- $F=qE$ force on a charge in an electric field.
	- F is force
	- E is electric field strength (comparable to [[Gravitational Field Definition|g]]for gravitational fields) in $N C^{-1}$
- **Definition 2:** The electrostatic force per unit positive charge acting on a stationary point charge at that point

Electric field strength is a **vector** quantity, because it is always directed away from a positive charge and towards a negative charge. 

###### Basic reminder?
- Opposite charges attract
- Like charges repel.
- [[Point charge]]
