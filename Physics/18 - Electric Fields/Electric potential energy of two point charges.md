- Electric potential energy $E_p$ at a point in an electric field is defined as:
	- **The work done in bringing a charge from infinity to that point.**
- Electric potential energy of a pair of point charges $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ is defined by:
	- $E_p = Q_1Q_2/4\pi Îµ_0 r$ 
	- derived from the original [[Electric field strength (Point charges)]] formula. Substitute into $W=Fd$ (work done formula) where r is the distance and F is the electric field strength formula and you get electric potential energy.
- Potential energy equation is **defined** by work done in moving point charge $Q_2$ from infinity towards a point charge $Q_1$ 
	- Equal to W = VQ
	- where W is work done J
	- V is electric potential JC^-1
	- Q is charge producing the potential C
	- Potential energy is **always positive**
	- At infinity, V =0 and hence $E_p$ is 0
