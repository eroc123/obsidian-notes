For a [[Electric fields intro|uniform field]]: 
$E = \Delta V/ \Delta d$ 
- E is electric field strength $V m^{-1}$\
- where V is potential difference and d is distance

This means that the closer the plates are (**lower separation**) , the stronger the field.
Similarly, the higher the [[potential difference]] between the plates, the stronger the field.
- Cannot be used for point charges since they have radial fields.
