- Formula:
	- $V= Q/4\piÎµ0r$ 
	- derivative of electric potential is electric field strength, similar to [[Gravitational Potential]]
- For a **positive charge**
	- As distance from the charge r decreases, potential V increases
	- work has to be done on a positive test charge to overcome repulsive force
- For a **negative charge**
	- same thing but with negative sign
