- Charged particle in an electric field will experience a force on it that will cause it to move
- If a charged particle remains still in a uniform field, it will move parallel/along electric field lines.
- If charged particle is in motion through a uniform electric field (between two charged parallel plates), it will experience a constant electric force and travel in a parabolic trajectory.
	- negative will be deflected to positive side with force acting towards positive side.
	- positive will be deflected to negative side with force acting towards negative side 
- **only applies to charged particles, uncharged particles like neutrons will pass right through with no direction change**
- amount of deflection depends on:
	- **mass** - greater mass = smaller deflection due to larger inertia (F=ma, larger mass must mean smaller acceleration)
	- **Charge** - greater magnitude of charge = greater deflection 
	- **Speed** - greater speed = smaller deflection (less time for force to act)
