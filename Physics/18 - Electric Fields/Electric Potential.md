- Electric Potential is defined as:
	- Work done **per unit positive charge** in brining a small test charge (test charges are positive) from **infinity to the point**
	- imagine the scenario where you are moving a positive charge to another positive charge - work must be done to overcome their force of repulsion.
	- Potential energy increases because energy is transferred to the charge being pushed.
	- Similar to [[Gravitational Potential]]
	- Is a
