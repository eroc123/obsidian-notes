- Electric Potential is defined as:
	- Work done **per unit positive charge** in brining a small test charge (test charges are positive) from **infinity to the point**
	- imagine the scenario where you are moving a positive charge to another positive charge - work must be done to overcome their force of repulsion.
	- Potential energy increases because energy is transferred to the charge being pushed.
	- Similar to [[Gravitational Potential]]
	- Is a **scalar quantity**

However, electric potential can still be negative. It is only negative when dealing with isolated negative charges. Positive when dealing with isolated positive charges.

- When moving a positive test charge near a negative charge, its electric potential decreases (work must be done to bring the particle **away** from the negative charge)
- When moving a positive test charge to a positive charge, its electric potential increases (work must be done to push the particle **towards** the positive charge)
