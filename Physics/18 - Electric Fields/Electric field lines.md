- Electric field lines are directed from positive to negative 
	- Therefore, field lines must always point away from a **positive charge** and point towards a **negative charge**
- Radial field spreads uniformly to or from the charge in all directions
	- usually field around point charge or sphere. 
	- ![[Point charge]]
	- something like this, if negative charge then have the arrows point inward instead of outwards.

##### Uniform electric field
- uniform electric fields have the same electric field strength throughout the field. E.g. field between oppositely charged parallel plates
- can be represented by **equally spaced field lines**
	- similar to uniform gravitational field lines on a planet's surface.
	- ![[Uniform Field]]

##### Non-uniform electric field
- Field lines are not equally spaced. 
	- **Stronger field** represented by field lines closer together
	- **Weaker field** represented by field lines further apart.
	- ![[Non-uniform field lines]]
	- Radial fields are considered **non uniform** 
		- the closer you are to the point charge, the closer each of the radial lines are to each other, meaning that the strength E is higher. 
		- similarly, the further you are from the point charge, the further each of the radial lines are from each other, meaning that the strength of the electric field E is smaller.
