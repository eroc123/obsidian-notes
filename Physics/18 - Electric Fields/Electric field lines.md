- Electric field lines are directed from positive to negative 
	- Therefore, field lines must always point away from a **positive charge** and point towards a **negative charge**
- Radial field spreads uniformly to or from the charge in all directions
	- usually field around point charge or sphere. 
	- ![[Point charge]]
	- something like this, if negative charge then have the arrows point inward instead of outwards.

##### Uniform electric field
- uniform electric fields have the same electric field strength throughout the field. E.g. field between oppositely charged parallel plates
- can be represented by equally spaced field lines
	- similar to uniform gravitational field lines on a planet's surface.
