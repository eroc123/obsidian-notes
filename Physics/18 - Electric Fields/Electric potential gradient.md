- Defined as the variation of electric potential at different points in an electrical field
	- **Electric field at a particular point is equal to the negative potential gradient at that point** - basically take derivative hahaha
- Potential gradient defined by equipotential lines - Always drawn perpendicular to field lines.
	- Similar to [[Gravitational Potential Diagram]]
	- Equipotential lines are lines of equal electric potential.
	- Around a radial field, equipotential lines are represented by concentric circles around the charge with increasing radius, with the lines becoming further away from each other.
	- In a uniform field, they are equally spaced.

##### Formula
$E = -\Delta V/\Delta r$ (for positive charges)
$E = -\Delta V/\Delta r$ (for negative charges)

where 
- E = electric field strength ($Vm^{-1}$)
- $\Delta V$ = change in potential (V)
- $\Delta r$ = displacement in direction of the field (m)

**test charge is always positive**
