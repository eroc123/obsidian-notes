- [[Electromagnetic Induction|e.m.f is generated]]
- When a conductor cuts through magnetic field lines, it causes a change in [[Magnetic Flux Definition|magnetic flux]], which causes [[WTO|work]] to be done
- **The process in which an e.m.f is induced in a closed circuit due to changes in magnetic flux**
- occurs either when the current carrying conductor cuts through magnetic fields or the direction of a magnetic field through a coil changes
- This principle is vital for moden-day society
