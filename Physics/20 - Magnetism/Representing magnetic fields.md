- Represented by magnetic field lines 
	- Shown using iron fillings or plotting compasses
	- Best represented on bar magnets where they have a north pole on one end and a south pole on the other
- Is produced by the movement of electrons within the atoms of a magnet
- Result of electrons circulating around the atoms, representing a tiny current and setting up a magnetic field
- Direction of magnetic field on a bar magnet is always from north to south

##### Like poles
- fields of two like poles repel - the fields "repel"
