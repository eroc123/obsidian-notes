- is a field of force, similar to [[Gravitational Field Definition|gravitational fields]] and electric fields 
- is created either by
	- moving electric charge
	- permanent magnets
- Permanent magnets are materials that produce a magnetic field
- Stationary charge will not produce a magnetic field
- Magnetic fields are created around a current carrying wire due to the movement of electrons
- Are invisible but can be observed by the force that pulls on magnetic materials such as iron or movement of a needle in a plotting compass.

	- **notes:** must inlude one straight line going into S and one straight line going out of N
	- one circular line from N to S on the side
	- a few curved lines
- Magnetic force stronger the closer the lines are
	- weaker the further apart they are
	- field lines are continuous
	- field lines never cross each other
- Uniform field:
	- field strength is same at all points
	- Represented by equally spaced lines - like electric fields
	
##### 3D magnetic fields
- X is used where magnetic field goes into page
- a dot and a circle around it is used where magnetic field goes out of page
