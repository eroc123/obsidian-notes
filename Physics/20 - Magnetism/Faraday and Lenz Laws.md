- Faraday's law tells us the magnitude of the induced e.m.f in electromagnetic induction and is defined as:
	- The magnetic of the [[Electromagnetic Induction|induced e.m.f]] is directly proportional to the rate of change in [[magnetic flux linkage]]
	- $\epsilon = N\Delta \phi / \Delta t$ 
- Lenz law gives the direction of the induced e.m.f by Faraday's Law:
	- Induced e.m.f acts in such a direction to produce effects which oppose the change causing it.
	-  $\epsilon = -N\Delta \phi / \Delta t$ 
	- Equation shows:
		- When a bar magnet goes through a coil, e.m.f is induced within the coil due to a change in magnetic flux 
		- A current is also induced (because of the e.m.f) which means the coil now has its own magnetic field.
		- Coils magnetic field acts in the opposite direction to the magnetic field of the bar magnet.
	- e.m.f will alternate with frequency of a.c. supply if a.c. is used

##### Evidence for Lenz law
- Known pole of the bar magnet is pushed into the coil, inducing a magnetic field in the coil. (e.g. push north pole into coil)
	- right [[Magnetic field in a solenoid|hand grip rule]], thumb indicates induced magnetic field direction
	- direction of current is observed on ammeter
		- reversing the magnet direction would reverse current direction
		- hence also reversing ammeter deflection
	- induced field repels the bar magnet, because of Lenz law
	- use **Fleming's right hand rule** to determine direction of induced current from a generator
