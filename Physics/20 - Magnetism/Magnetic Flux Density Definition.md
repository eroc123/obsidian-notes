- The **force** acting **per unit current per unit length** on a current-carrying **placed perpendicular** to a magnetic field.
- $B = F/IL$ where B is Magnetic Flux Density, I is current and L is length of the conductor
- Measured in units of Tesla (T)
- Earth's magnetic flux density is 0.032mT and a fridge magnet is 5mT
- If the current-carrying conductor is not perpendicular to the magnetic field lines, you have to multiply $F=BIL$ by $sin\theta$ - basically resolving the force (get the force component which is perpendicular to the magnetic field line)
##### Max and min force
- Max is when current-carrying conductor is perpendicular 
- Min is when current-carrying conductor is parallel (0 force experienced)
