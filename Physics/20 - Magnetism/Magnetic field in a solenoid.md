- Magnetic fields can be produced anywhere where there is a flowing current, e.g. long straight wires, long solenoids (wrapped wire in many coils) and flat circular coils
- Field lines in a current-carrying conductor are always rings centered on a central wire.
- Field lines are strongest near the wire and become weaker further away from wire
- Reverse current reverses field direction

##### How to draw magnetic field lines for a straight wire
- Use Maxwell's right hand screw rule. Thumb is current direction and direction of finger curl is the direction of the magnetic fields. (conventional current, positive to negative charge)

##### Magnetic field lines for a solenoid
- Combine multiple ciruclar magnetic fields and you get a magnetic field similar to a bar magnet.

- Field lines emerge from north pole and return to south pole.
- To determine current direction, use the right hand grip rule.
- Fingers represent direction of current flow (the direction they are curled) and thumb represents magnetic field line (thumb points to the north).

##### Factors affecting field strength in a solenoid
- More turns in a coil
	- Concentrates magnetic field lines (closer together), making magnet stronger.
- Adding a core made of a ferrous (magnetic/iron rich) material like iron
	- When a current flows through a solenoid, it magnetizes the iron core, which acts as an additional magnet, making the magnet even stronger. (up to several hundred times)
