##### Moving a magnet through a coil
- Coil is connected to sensitive voltmeter, a bar magnet can be moved in and out of the coil to induce an e.m.f
- **Expected outcome when bar magnet is not moving** - voltmeter has 0 reading
	- when rate of change of flux is 0, e.m.f is 0 (no work is done)
- When bar is moved into the coil, positive E.M.F is recorded
- When bar is moved back out of the coil, negative e.m.f is recorded
- Increasing speed of the bar magnet increases magnitude of e.m.f induced 
- direction of current and e.m.f in conductor is such that it opposes the change that produces it.

##### How to increase magnitude of emf induced 
- moving fast through the coil
- adding more turns to the coil
- increasing strength of bar magnet

#### Experiment 2 - moving wire through magnetic field
- When a long wire is connected to a voltmeter and moved between two magnets, an e.m.f is induced
- **Note** there is no current flowing through a wire to start with.

- Wire is **not moving,** the voltmeter shows **zero** reading
	- Wire is still held inside, or outside, the magnets, rate of change of flux is 0 so no e.m.f is induced
- As the wire is moved through between the magnets, an e.m.f is induced within the wire, shown momentarily by the reading on the voltmeter
	- As the wire moves, it ‘cuts through’ the magnetic field lines of the magnet, generating a change in magnetic flux
- When the wire is taken back out of the magnet, an e.m.f is induced in the opposite direction
	- As the wire changes direction, the direction of the current changes
	- The voltmeter will momentarily show a reading with the opposite sign
- As before, the direction of the electric current, and e.m.f, induced in the conductor is such that it opposes the change that produces it
- Factors that will increase the induced e.m.f are:
	- Increase length of wire 
	- Increase magnetic flux density
	- Moving the wire between the magnets faster 
- **In general - the sole way to increase e.m.f is to increase the rate of change of magnetic flux which is done by cutting through more magnetic field lines per unit time. This can be done in several way**
