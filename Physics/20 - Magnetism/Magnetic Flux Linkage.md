-  The **magnetic flux linkage** is a quantity commonly used for solenoids which are made of _N_ turns of wire
- defined as: the product of the magnetic flux and the number of turns
- formula is: $N\phi = BAN$
	- $\phi$ = magnetic flux (Wb)
	  N = number of coils
	  B = magnetic flux density (T)
	  A = cross sectional area ($m^2$)
- $N\phi$ is the units of Weber turns (Wb turns)
- Component of flux density which is perpendicular is equal to:
	- $N\phi = BANcos\theta$
