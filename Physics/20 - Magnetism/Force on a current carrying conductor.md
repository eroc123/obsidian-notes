- When a **current carrying conductor** has current flowing through perpendicular to the direction of a magnetic field, a force is generated **perpendicular** to the current and direction of magnetic field (B).
	- force is mutually perpendicular to both current and field direction
	- use Flemings left hand rule to determine force, current and field direction
	- **T**humb - **t**hrust direction (force)
	- **F**irst finger (index) - **f**ield direction
	- Se**co**nd finger (middle) - **c**urrent dirrection
