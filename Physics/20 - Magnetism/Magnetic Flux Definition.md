- Electromagnetic induction is when [[Electromotive Force|e.m.f]] is induced in a closed conductor due to it moving through a [[magnetic fields|magnetic field]] 
	- Happens when a conductor cuts through a magnetic field
	- amount of e.m.f is determined by magnetic flux
	- amount of flux varies as the coil rotates within the field
		- Flux is total field within an area, max when conductor is perpendicular to the area, min when conductor is parallel to the area
**Definition:** The product of the magnetic flux density and the cross-sectional area perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic flux density - perpendicular area must cut through field lines
- **number of magnetic field lines through a given area**

##### Calculate magnetic flux
- Defined by symbol $\phi$ 
- Units are called Webers (Wb)
- $\phi$ = BA where B is [[Magnetic Flux Density Definition|magnetic flux density]] (how many field lines in a given area) and A is cross sectional area
- If magnetic field lines are not perpendicular, the component of magnetic flux density B that is perpendicular to the cross sectional area is taken instead using $cos\theta$ where $\theta$ is the angle between the magnetic field lines and the line perpendicular to the plane of an area (normal line)

- E.M.F - induced in a circuit when magnetic flux linkage changes with respect to time. e.m.f. is induced when there is:
	- changing magnetic flux density B
	- changing cross sectional area A
	- chang in angle $\theta$
