- Defined as a device consisting of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields where charged particles with a specific velocity can be filtered.
- Velocity selectors are used in devices such as mass spectrometers to produce a beam of charged particles all travelling at the same velocity.
##### construction
- two horizontal oppositely charged plates are placed next to each other in a vacuum, creating a uniform electric field with strength E
- there is also a uniform magnetic field with flux density B applied perpendicular to the electric field.

##### Operation
- Electric force does not depend on velocity $F_E = EQ$ 
- Magnetic force does depend on velocity $F_B = BQv$ 
- Magnetic force is stronger for particles travleiing faster.
- Filter exact particles with exact velocity you must make sure magnetic field force and electric field force are directly opposite in direction but equal in magnitude
- Since **electric force and magnetic force are equal**, particles with desired speed v will pass through **undeflected**. $F_E = F_B$
- EQ = BQv
- $v = E/B$ - desired speed v where particles will pass through is a ratio between electric field and magnetic field force strength
- If a particle has a speed greater than v or less than v, it will get **deflected** either by the magnetic force or electric force, causing it to go off path and **collide** with one of the charged plates. It does not pass through the gap and hence gets **filtered out*
- basically particles not of speed v are removed
- gravity is negligable
