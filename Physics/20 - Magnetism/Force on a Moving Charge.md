- the magnetic force on an isolating moving charge, e.g. electron is given by
	- $F=BQvsin\theta$ 
	- F is force on charge
	- Q is charge in coulombs
	- B is magnetic flux density (T)
	- v is speed of charge $ms^{-1}$
	- $\theta$ is angle between charges velocity and [[Magnetic fields|magnetic field]]
- can use flemings left hand rule here too, except with current being replaced by velocity. 
##### Example
- When an electron moves through a magnetic field (perpendicular), it experiences a force perpendicular to both the direction of movement and the magnetic field
