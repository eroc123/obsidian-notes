- **Definition:** Potential gradient at a particular point in a gravitational field is the change in potential per meter
- potential gradient = $\Delta V/\Delta r$
- Potential Gradient of Earth at the surface = $9.81kg^{-1} m^{-1}$
- $\Delta V = \Delta W/m$ - change in potential is equal to change in work divided by mass


- $g = -\Delta V/\Delta r$
- $g = F_{grav}/m$
