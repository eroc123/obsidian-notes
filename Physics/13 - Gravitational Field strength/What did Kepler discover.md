- Speed of satellite in orbit = $GM/r = v^2$. Derive from $F= GmM/r^2$ and $F = mv^2/r$
- Speed = circumference of orbit / Period of orbit
-  $v = 2\pi r/T$ 
- $v^2 = 4\pi r^2 /T^2$
- $GM/r = 4\pi r^2 /T^2$
- Rearranged as $GM/4\pi^2 = r^3/T^2$

- GM is constant since M is the mass of the sun and G is the gravitational constant.
- $4 \pi^2$ is also constant
- Hence $GM/4 \pi^2$ is constant
- Since LHS is constant, RHS which is $r^3/T^2$ must also be constant.
