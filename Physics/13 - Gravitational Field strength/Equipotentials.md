- Near the surface of a planet gravitational field can be considered as uniform as the distances relative to the planet's radius is very small
- Equipotentials are horizontal and parallel to the ground


1 kg mass raised from Earth's surface by 1m gains 9.81J of G.P.E. For each meter, it gains another 9.81J for the next metre.


- $\Delta E_p = mg\Delta h$
- $E_p$ - gravitational potential energy
- only applied where $\Delta h$ is small compared to planet radius.
