##### Gravity between 0 and R
- Gravity increases linearly from 0 at 0R to 1g at 1R.
- This is because there is less mass between you and the center of the body, reducing the gravitational force acting on you.
	- There is 0g at the center because the mass is equal at all points around you, meaning that the resulting gravitational force is 0.
