**First law** - Planets orbit the sun in ellipses with the sun at one focus
**Second law** - Each planet moves in so that an imaginary line drawn from the sun to any planet sweeps out equal areas of space in equal intervals of time.
**Third law** - The square of the orbital period T of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the average distance of the planet from the sun ($r^3$ )
