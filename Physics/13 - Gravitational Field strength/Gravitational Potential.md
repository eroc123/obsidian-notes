- gravity is 0 at inifinity.
- [[Gravitational Field Definition|g]] acts opposite to Gravitational Potential.
- Gravitational Potential **in a gravitational field.** - Is GPE per unit mass and is equal to the work done per unit mass in moving from infinity to that point. 



- **Definition** Gravitational potential **V** at a point is the work done per unit mass to move a small object from infinity to that point. 
	- think about it this way. If there was a rocket with a gravitational potential meter, it would reach 0 when it has flown infinitely far from Earth. The closer to earth it is, the lower the gravitational potential (negative).

$V = work done/mass$ 

Units : $Jkg^-1$
