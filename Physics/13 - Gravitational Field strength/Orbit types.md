##### Orbit type 1 - Geostationary
- position satellite at a point above earth (around 37000 km) where its orbital period is exactly the same as Earth's rotational period (24 hours)
- Hence satellite stays exactly at the same point above the Earth at all times.

##### Orbit type 2 - Polar orbit
- Orbit over the north pole. 
- Allows satellite to 

##### Orbit type 3 
- Collection of many satellites.
- SatNav receives signal from several satellites at the same time.
