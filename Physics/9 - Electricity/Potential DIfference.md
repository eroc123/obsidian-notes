- Potential difference across a component is defined as **energy transferred per unit charge flowing from one point to another**
- Measured in V ($JC^{-1}$) Joules per coulomb
	- Essentially measures the amount of energy transferred per unit charge
	- e.g. a light bulb with a voltage of 3V will mean that every coulomb of charge passing through will lose 3J of energy
	- $V = W/Q$
- Potential difference of a power supply connected in [[Series Circuit|series]] is shared between all components in the circuit

#### Measuring voltage

- [[Voltmeter]] always set up in [[Parallel Circuit|parallel]] to the component you are measuring voltage for

- Charges act as energy carriers that can collect energy from the battery.
- As the charge move through the bulb, it has to put in effort in order to do so.
- Bulb is lighting up because of the energy the charge throws into the bulb
