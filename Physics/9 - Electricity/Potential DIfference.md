- Potential difference across a component is defined as **energy transferred per unit charge flowing from one point to another**
- Measured in V ($JC^{-1}$) Joules per coloumb
	- Essentially measures the amount of energy transferred per unit charge
	- e.g. a light bulb with a voltage of 3V will mean that every coloumb of charge passing through will lose 3J of energy
	- $V = W/Q$
- Potential difference of a power supply connected in series is shared between all components in the circuit

#### Usage of a voltmeter

- Always set up in parallel to the component you are measuering voltage for
