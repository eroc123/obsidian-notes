**Metallic Conductor:** At room temp
- Current is directly proportional to the potential difference
- Straight line through origin
- Follows Ohm's law
**Semiconductor Diode:**
- Used in a circuit to allow the current to only flow in a specific direction
- When the current is in the direction of the arrowhead symbol (forward bias), there is a sharp increase in potential difference and current on right side of graph (direction of arrowhead). 
	- Suggests that when there is a potential difference, current can flow
- When the diode is switched around (arrowhead symbol is against current direction), it is called reverse bias. Zero reading of current or potential difference on the left side of the graph. (no current)
**Filament Lamp**
- Current increases at a proportionally slower rate than potential difference. (current tapers off)
- As current increases, the lamp heats up. 
- [[Resistivity#Relation with temperature|Heat increases resistance]], which opposes the current
- As the graph curves, the resistance increases.
