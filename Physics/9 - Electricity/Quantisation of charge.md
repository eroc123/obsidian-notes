- One electron has one negative charge
- One proton has one positive charge
- Dependent on how many electrons/protons there are, meaning that there is a definite minimum magnitude, with all higher charges coming in multiples of that magnitude
- One electron/proton has a charge of $1.60 * 10^{-19}C$ denoted with e
