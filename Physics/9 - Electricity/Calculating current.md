- In conductors, current is created by movement of charge carriers, e.g. free electrons (ions can also be charge carriers but they are generally in liquids and gases)
- Positive charge carriers drift in the same direction as conventional current (positive to negative) whilst negative charge carriers drift in the opposite direction of conventional current 

**Drift Speed:** is the average speed that charge carriers travel through the conductor. Generally quite low, but due to high density of charge carriers, current flow appears to happen instantaneously.

Equation: $I = Anvq$ where I is current, A is cross sectional area, v is average drift speed, n is the number density of charge carriers ($m^{-3}$)
