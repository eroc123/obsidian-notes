Current (I) - The amount of charge flowing per unit time

I = Q/t

**Electric current is the flow of charge carriers and is measured in units of amperes (A) or amps**

- Can either be negative or positive
- Conventional current goes in the direction from the positive terminal to the negative terminal
- Electrons flow from the negative terminal to positive terminal
- Conventional current is opposite direction to electron flow
