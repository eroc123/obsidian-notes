- For a conductor at a constant temperature (for some conductors), potional difference is directly propotrional to current

Experiment set up:
![[ohms law.png]]
- Fixed Resistor - resistor that always has the same resistance
- Variable resistor - a resistor whose resistance value can be changed

- If a graph of current plotted against potential difference is a straight line through the origin, the electric component is said to obey Ohm's law.
	- [[Filament Bulb|Filament lamps]] do not obey Ohm's law
