- Sensory resistors are **[[Ohm's Law|non-ohmic]]**, meaning that their I-V graph is not a straight line through the origin - generally it is a more curved line


#### Thermistor

- Resistance changes depending on temperature
- As temperature increases, the resistance of a thermistor decreases

- Used in temperature sensors and used in circuits in ovens, fire alarms and digital thermometsrs.
	- As thermistor gets hotter, resistance decreases
	- As thermistor gets cooler, resistance increases
