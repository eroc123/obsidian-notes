- Sensory resistors are **[[Ohm's Law|non-ohmic]]**, meaning that their I-V graph is not a straight line through the origin - generally it is a more curved line
#### Light-dependent Resistor
- As light intensity increases, the resistance of an LDR decreases
- ![[LDR.png]]
- Used in light sensors such as street lighting
	- When its dark, resistance is very high (millions of ohms)
	- When its light, resistance is low (tens of ohms)

#### Thermistor

- Resistance changes depending on temperature
- As temperature increases, the resistance of a thermistor decreases

- Used in temperature sensors and used in circuits in ovens, fire alarms and digital thermometsrs.
	- As thermistor gets hotter, resistance decreases
	- As thermistor gets cooler, resistance increases
