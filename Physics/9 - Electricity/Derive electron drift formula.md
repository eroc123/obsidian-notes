**Uses formulas:**
- $I=Q/t$
- Total charge is no. electrons multiplied by volume of the metal and the charge on each electron
- $Q = NAle$ - where e is electron charge, N is number of electrons 
- Substitute for Q
- $I = NAle/t$
- Formula for speed is $v=l/t$ where l is length travelled, t is time and v is drift velocity (IN METERS PER SECOND)
- $I = NAve$ where e is $1.602 Ã— 10^{-19} C$
