- All materials have **some resistance** to the flow of charge.
- As free electrons move through a metal wire, they collide with ions which get in their way - some or all kinetic energy of electrons get transferred on collision

- Resistivity equation - $R = ρL/A$ where R is resistance, L is length of the wire, A is the cross sectional area and ρ is the resistivity ($\Omega m$)
	- *Resistivity of a 1m long piece of wire with a cross-sectional area of -1*
	- The longer the wire, the greater its resistance
	- The thicker the wire, the smaller its resistance
- The higher the resistivity of a material, the higher its resistance
- Insulators have a very high resistance, basically no current will flow through

#### Relation with temperature
- The higher the temperature, the higher the resistance
- This is because atoms vibrate faster at high temperatures
	- This increases the likelihood that electrons collide with the vibrating atoms, impeding flow and decreasing current.
	- Resistance therefore increases
