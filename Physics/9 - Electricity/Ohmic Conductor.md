For a resistor, the current-voltage graph is a straight line through the origin

The current through a resistor is directly proportional to the potential difference (voltage) across the resistor

The gradient of the line an I-V graph is equal to 1/R

This is for an Ohmic conductor only

The is because R for a metallic conductor is constant under constant physical conditions
It does not apply for the filament bulb
