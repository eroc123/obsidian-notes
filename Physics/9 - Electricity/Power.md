- Power is the rate of [[Work Done|work being done]] ($P=W/t$)
	- [[Potential Difference]] is the work done per unit [[charge]] ($V = W/Q$)
	- [[Physics/9 - Electricity/Electric Current|Current]] is the rate of flow of charge ($I = Q/t$)
	- **Derive:**
		- $P = QV/t$
		- $It=Q$
		- $P=ItV/t$
		- $P=IV$
- $V = IR$ can also be used to express $P=IV$ in terms of $R$
