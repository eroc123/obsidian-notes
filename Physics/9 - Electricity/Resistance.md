- Resistance is the opposition to the current
- The higher the resistance, the lower the current (as it opposes the current)
- Related in the equation $V=IR$
- Measured in ohms ($\Omega$) - defined as one volt per ampere

- Conductors have rows of tightly packed atoms, all of which obstructs the flow of charges
- Resistance is the ratio of [[potential difference]] and current of a conductor

$R = V/I$ (Formula arries from [[Ohm's law]])
V: pd
I: current
R: resistance ($\ohm$)
