- Resistance is the opposition to the current
- The higher the resistance, the lower the current (as it opposes the current)
- Related in the equation $V=IR$
- Measured in ohms ($\Omega$) - defined as one volt per ampere

- Conductors have rows of tightly packed atoms, all of which obstructs the flow of charges
- Resistance is the ratio
