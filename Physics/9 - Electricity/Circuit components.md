# Ammeter

Ammeter measures the current through part of the circuit. It is always connected in series.

# Voltmeter

A voltmeter measure the potential difference between two points. It is always connected in parallel.

# Cell

A cell provides voltage to a circuit. This pushes the charge around the circuit.

# Lamp

The symbol for an indicator or any light source is the same (not including a light emitting diode)

# Diode

A diode only allows current to flow in one direction. (In the way the triangle points) The diode has a very high resistance in the reverse direction . (For LED add the two little arrows)
