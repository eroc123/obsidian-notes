- All materials which can deform follow Hooke's Law $$\Delta L \propto F$$

where $\Delta L$ is change in length and F is force applied.

To convert from proportion to equation, a constant k must be introduced.
k is the spring constant, measured in $Nm^-1$ or $Ncm^-1$. Determines how stiff the spring is.
$$F = k\Delta L$$
