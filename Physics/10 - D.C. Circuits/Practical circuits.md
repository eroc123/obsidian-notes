- **Switch:** Turn the circuit on (closed), or off (open)
- **Fixed resistor:** A resistor limits the flow of current. A fixed resistor has a resistance it cannot change
- **Variable resistor:** A resistor with a slider that can be used to change its resistance. Used often in dimmer switches and volume controls
- **Thermistor:** The resistance of a thermistor depends on its temperature. As its temperature increases, its resistance decreases and vice versa
- **Light-dependent resistor (LDR):** The resistance of an LDR depends on the light intensity. As the light intensity increases, its resistance decreases and vice versa
- **Diode:** A diode allows current to flow in one direction only. They are used to convert AC to DC current
- **Light-emitting diode (LED):** This is equivalent to a diode and emits light when a current passes through it. These are used for aviation lighting and displays (TVs, road signs)
- **Ammeter:** Used to measure the current in a circuit. Connected in series with other component
- **Voltmeter:** Use to measure the potential difference of an electrical component. Connected in parallel with component![[Circuit 2.png]]
