- a 3 terminal variable resistor in which the resistance is manually varied to control the flow of electric current
- think of it as a long resistance wire - when you position the jockey (wire lead) at different points, you vary the [[obsidian-notes/Physics/9 - Electricity/Resistance|Resistance]]

#### Galvanometer
- Used to detect very small current
- used to detect direction of current flow
- think of it as a wind vane that points in the direction that wind is blowing
