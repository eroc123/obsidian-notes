- A potentiometer is similar to a variable resistor connected as a potential divider to give a continuously variable output voltage
- A potentiometer is a single component that (in its simplest form) consists of a coil of wire with a sliding contact, midway along it
- Sliding contact separates potentiometer into two parts, one with higher resistance (longer length) and one with lower resistance (lower length)
- Sliding the contact changes resistance of the of the upper and lower parts of potentiometer, which changes potential difference.

#### Galvanometer
- Used to detect very small current
