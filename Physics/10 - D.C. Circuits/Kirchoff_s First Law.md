- The sum of currents entering a junction always equal the sum of currents out of the junction. 
- Conservation of charge - current should not decrease or increase in a circuit when it splits.
- **Branch:** Path connecting two junctions
- **Junction:** point where at least three circuit paths meet 
![[branch and junction]]

$I_T = I_1 + I_2...$ 

- Current in a series circuit always remains the same due to this law.
	- They do use up potential (voltage)

- Current in a parallel circuit divides at junction, with each branch having a different current. Once the branches merge, the end current will equal the starting current
