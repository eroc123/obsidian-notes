Definition: The electromotive force (e.m.f.) of a source is the energy transferred per unit charge in driving charge around a complete circuit

- e.m.f is also the potential difference across the cell when no current is flowing
- Unit is volts.

### Difference between EMF and Potential Difference

- Difference is the type of energy transfer per unit charge.
- **Potential difference**: When electrical energy is transferred to other forms of energy in a circuit (e.g. heat if its a heater or sound if its z buzzer)
- **E.m.f**: Transfer of energy from the power supply to electrical charges within the circuit - amount of chemical energy converted to electrical energy per colomb charge when charge passes through a power supply.
