- All power supplies have internal resistance between their terminals 
- The charge that is circulating through the power supply dissipates some electrical energy every time it passes through - this is why cells heat up.
- The voltage measured across the terminals when a current is flowing is lower than the actual true value of emf of the cell due to internal resistance 
- r is used to represent internal resistance
- Total resistance of a circuit is equal to R + r 
- $I = \epsilon/(R+r)$
- $\epsilon = I(R+r)$
