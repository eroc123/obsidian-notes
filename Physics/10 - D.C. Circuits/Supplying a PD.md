$V_0$ or $V_s$ is total resistance
$V_1 = IR_1$
$V_2 = IR_2$
$V_1 = V_0R_1/(R_1 + R_2)$
- Total resistance of the circuit - $R_1 + R_2$

If $R1 >> R2$ then V1 is more or less the power supply
If $R1 << R2$ then V1 is close to 0V

- $V_0$ as an input to the potential divider and V1 as an output. The circuit itself provides a way to tap off a voltage between 0V and $V_0$
