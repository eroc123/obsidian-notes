- Edwin Hubble investigated the light spectra emitted from a large number of galaxies
- Used [[doppler shift|redshift]] data to determine the recession velocities of these galaxies, and [[Standard Candle and Stellar distances|standard candle]] to determine distances.
- formulated relationship known as Hubble's law, states that: **The recession speed of galaxies moving away from Earth is proportional to their distance from Earth**
- calculated using $v=H_0d$ 
- where v is galaxies recessional velocity
- d is distance between galaxy and Earth
- $H_0$ is hubbles constant, or ratio of expansion of universe in $s^{-1}$
	- The further away a galaxy, the faster its recession velocity
	- Gradient of a graph of recession velocity against distance is equal to the Hubble constant
