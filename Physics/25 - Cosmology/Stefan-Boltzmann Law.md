- star's luminosity depends on two factors:
	- Surface temperature
	- Radius
- States that: **the total energy emitted by a black body per unit area per second is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature of the body**
	- $L = 4\pi r^2 \sigma T^4$ 
	- L is luminosity
	- r is radius of the star
	- $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant
	- T is the surface temperature of the star

##### Estimating radius of stars
- radius of a star can be estimated by combining Wien's displacement law and the Stefan Boltzmann law 
- procedure for use is as follows:
	- use [[Wien's displacement law]] to find the surface temperature of the star
	- Use [[Defining Luminosity|inverse square law of flux]]  to find luminosity of star
	- use Stefan-boltzmann law to obtain stellar radius.
