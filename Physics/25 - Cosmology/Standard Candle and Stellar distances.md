- standard candle is defined as:
	- An astronomical object which has a known luminosity due to a characteristic quality possessed by that class of object
- example of standard candle:
	- Cepheid variable stars
		- type of pulsating star which increases and decreases in brightness over a set time period
		- Variation has a well defined relationship to luminosity
	- type 1a supernovae
		- Supernova explosion involving white dwarf
		- Luminosity at the time of the explosion is always the same

##### Using standard candles as a distance indicator
- Extremely difficult to measure astronomical distances 
- Direct distance measurement only possible if the object is close enough to the Earth
- For more distant objects, indirect methods must be used - where standard candles come in useful
- If luminosity of source is known, distance can be estimated based on how bright it appears from earth
	- Astronomers measure [[Defining Luminosity|radiant flux intensity]], of electromagnetic radiation arriving at the Earth
	- Since luminosity is known (as object is a standard candle), distance can be calculated using inverse square law of flux
- Each standard candle method can measure distances within a certain range
- Collating data and measurements from each method allows astronomers to build up a larger picture of the scale of the universe
	- called cosmic distance ladder
