- Lumonisity L is defined as:
	- Total power output of radiation emitted by a star
- Measured in units of Watts (W)
- Radiant flux intensity F is defined as:
	- **Observed amount of intensity, or the radiant power transmitted normally through a surface per unit area, of radiation measured on Earth.**
- Best way to describe:
	- Luminosity is the total radiation that **leaves the star**
	- Radiant flux intensity is the amount of radiation **measured on Earth**
	- Radiant flux intensity is only a small fraction of luminosity, due to inverse square law. (spreads out over distance)

##### Inverse Square Law of Flux
- light sources which are further away appear fainter because the light it emits is spread out over a greater area
- The moment light leaves the star, it begins to spread out uniformly through a spherical shell
	- Surface area of a sphere is equal to $4\pi r^2$ 
	- radius r of the sphere is equal to distance d between star and Earth
	- when radiation reaches the Earth, it has been spread over an area of $4\pi d^2$ 
	- Inverse square law of flux can therefore be calculated using $F=L/(4\pi d^2)$ 
	- equation assumes no energy is absorbed between the star and Earth and the power from the star radiates uniformly through space
- Equation tells us:
	- For a given star, luminosiy is constant
	- Radiant flux follows an inverse square law
	- The greater the radiant flux, the close the star is to earth (smaller d)
