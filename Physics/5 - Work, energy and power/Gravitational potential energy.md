G.P.E : Energy of an object due to its position%%TODO: Expand on this%%
- The higher the object, the higher its G.P.E ($\Delta GPE = mg\Delta h$)
	- where $g=9.81m^-2$
- The heavier the object, the higher its G.P.E

As the box falls down, work is being done by the object (due to the weight $mg$ of the box)
$W = F \times h$
$F = mg$
$W = mgh$

*This would only work when gravitational field is uniform*
