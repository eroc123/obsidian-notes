If there are two springs in parallel holding the same mass, then the formula would be $W=k_p\Delta L + k_q\Delta L$ where W is the total weight of the load, $k_p$ and $k_q$ is the spring constants of each spring and $\Delta L$ is the change in extension. 

- This is because the force held by the two springs (as both springs are holding the same load) combined will equal to the weight of the load. $F_p + F_q = W$
- $\Delta L$ is the same for both springs, as they both extend the same length to hold the same mass.
- Substitute in the two formulas for hookes law and you get to the formula $W=k_p\Delta L + k_q\Delta L$
- therefore $W=\Delta L(k_p + k_q)$
- $k_p + k_q = k$
