- Electrons flow back from the negative plate of the capacitor to the positive plate through a resistor (which manages the current)
- Current starts off large (large charge being moved per second) but then drops rapidly to 0
- Variation with time of **current, charge and P.D.** all drop exponentially during discharge

- All graphs are **identical**
	- Higher resistance = longer discharge, current will have a more gradual decrease and charge will be released more slowly
	- Lower resistance = faster discharge, current will have a more rapid decrease and charge will be released more quickly
