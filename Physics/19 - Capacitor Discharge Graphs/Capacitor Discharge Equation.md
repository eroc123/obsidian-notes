##### Time Constant
- The length of time taken to discharge a capacitor through a resistor

**Exact Definition:** The time taken for the charge, current or voltage of a discharging capacitor to decrease to 37% of its original value 
**OR** the time taken for the charge of a capacitor to decrease to $1/e$ of the original value.
- symbol is $\tau$ in seconds
- Equation: $\tau = RC$
- $\tau$ is time constant
- R is resistance of resistor $\ohm$ 
- C is capacitance of capacitor


##### Capacitor discharge equations
- They are of the form $X = X_0e^{-t/RC}$
- X is current, charge or potential difference (they are [[Capacitor Discharge Operation|exactly identical]])
- $X_0$ is initial current, charge or potential difference
- e is the exponential function
- t is time
- RC = resistance ($\ohm$) * capacitance (F)
