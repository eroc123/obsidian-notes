| Type of spring | Extension of spring (length of spring when extended subtracted by unextended length of spring) | The load on the spring |      

- Set up clamp, boss, stand
- Measure unextended length of spring using ruler
- Hang the spring off the clamp
- Hang different known loads off the spring within a reasonable range
	- There should be a consistent step size between each load
	- Minimum is 0
	- Max is before spring is damaged
- Need around 6 data points (6 readings).
- 
- Measure the length of the spring for each load.
- Log down the weight of the load and the extension of the spring subtracted by the unextended length
