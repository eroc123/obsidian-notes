- in regards to [[Radioactive tracers]]
- When a positron is emitted from the tracer, it travels less than a milimetre before it collides with an electron
- Positron and electron annihilate, [[energy and mass|mass becomes pure energy]] in the form of two gamma rays which move apart in opposite directions
- Annihilation is defined as:
	- When a particle meets its equivalent antiparticle they are both destroyed and their mass is converted into energy
	- as with all collisions, mass, energy and momenum are conserved

##### Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning
- once tracer is introduced into the body, it has a short [[Half life definition|half-life]], so, it begins emitting positrons immediately
	- allows for short exposure time to radiation
	- short half life means that patient must be scanned quickly and not all hospitals have access to expensive PET scanners
- in PET scanning
	- positrons emitted by decay of [[Radioactive tracers]] 
	- travel small distance before annihilation and annihilate when they interact with electrons in the tissue
	- produces a pair of gamma-ray photons which travel in opposite directions
