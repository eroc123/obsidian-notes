- Defined as: reduction of energy due to the absorption of ultrasound as it travels through a material
- Attenuation coefficient of the ultrasound is expressed in decibels per centimere lost for every incremental increase in megahertz frequency
	- 0.5 $dB cm^{-1}$ is lose for every 1MHz
	- equation is: $I=I_0 e^{-\mu x}$ 
	- $\mu$ is the absorption coefficient
	- x is distance travelled through material
Absorption coefficient $\mu$ will vary from material to material
Attenutation is not a major problem in ultrasound scanning as the scan relies on the reflection of the ultrasounds at the boundaries of materials
