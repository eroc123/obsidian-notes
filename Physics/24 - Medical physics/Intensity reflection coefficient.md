- **Ratio of the intensity of the reflected wave relative to the incident (transmitted) wave**
- Calculated using fraction:
	- $\alpha = I_R/I_0$ 
	- $\alpha = (Z_2-Z_1)^2/(Z_2+Z_1)^2$ 
	- $\alpha$ is intensity reflection coeffeicient
	- $I_R$ is intensity of reflected wave
	- $I_0$ is intensity of the incident wave
	- $Z_1$ acoustic impedance of one material
	- $Z_2$ acoustic impedance of second material
- large ratio = large reflection
- small ratio = small reflection

##### Coupling medium
- when ultrasound is used in medical imaging, a coupler is needed between the transducer and the body
- soft tissues of body is much denser than air
- if air is present between teh transducer and the body, then almost all the ultrasound energy will be reflected.
- Coupling gel is placed between the transducer and the body, as skin and the coupling gel have a similar density, so little ultrasound is reflected. 
	- impedence matching
