- can provide detailed images of soft tissue and blood vessels
- When treating patients, aim is to:
	- reduce exposure to radiation as much as possible
	- improve the contrast of the image

##### Exposure reduction
- x-rays are ionizing, meaning they can cause damage to living tissue and can potentially lead to cancerous mutations
- aluminium filters are used
	- many wavelengths of X-rays are produced
	- longer-wavelengths of X-rays are more penetrating and hence more likely to be absorbed
	- They do not contribute to the image and pose more a health hazard
	- Aluminium sheet absorbs these long wavelength X-rays making them safer.

##### Contrast and sharpness
- **contrast** defined as: The difference in degree of blackening between structures
- Allows a clear difference between tissues to be seen
- Can be improved by:
	- Using the correct level of X-ray hardness: hard-x rays for bones, soft x-rays for tissue
	- Using contrast media
- **sharpness** defined as: How well defined the edges of structures are
- Image sharpness can be improved by: 
	- using a narrower X-ray beam
	- reducing X-ray scattering by using a collimator or lead grid
	- smaller pixel size
