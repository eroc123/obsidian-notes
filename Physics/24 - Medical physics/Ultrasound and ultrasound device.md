- high frequency sound above the range of human hearing
- above 20kHz

	- how it works: 
		- a.c. power comes in through power cable. 
		- electrodes on either side of piezoelectric crystal apply alternating potential difference.
		- the alternating potential difference causes the piezoelectric crystal to expand and contract at the [[Piezoelectric Crystals|same frequency]] as the frequency of the a.c. current.
		- this means that crystal must be cut to a specific size in order to induce resonance (so the vibrations build on each other instead of damping each other out)
		- Damping material behind the piezoelectric crystal, usually made of epoxy resin to stop the crystal vibrating too much 
		- produces short pulses which increase resolution
		- 

- can be used both ways, can either be used to produce a sound wave (by applying an e.m.f) or measure the recieved sound wave, which creates a p.d. across the two electrodes which alternates. Recieved signal can be processed and used for medical diagnosis
