- X rays have wavelengths in the range $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-13}$ meters
- produced when fast-moving electrons rapidly decelerate and transfer their kinetic energy into photons of EM radiation

##### Producing X-rays
- at the cathode - electrons are released by thermonic emission
- electrons accelerated to the anode at high speed
- when electrons bombard metal target, they lose some of their energy by [[Physics/22 - Quantum Physics/emission spectra|transferring it to photons]] 
- electrons in outer shells of atoms move into space in the lower energy levels
- as they move to lower energy levels, the electrons release energy in the form of X-ray photons
- when an electron is accelerated, it gains energy equal to the [[Electron Volt]] - can be calculated using $E_{max} = eV$
- max energy an X ray photon can have
- Max x-ray frequency $f_{max}$ or the minimum wavelength $\lambda_{min}$ that can be produced is calculated [[Physics/22 - Quantum Physics/Photon|using equation]] $f_{max} = eV/h$
- $\lambda = hc/eV$ 
- derived from $E_{max} = hf_{max}$ and $hf_{max} = hc/\lambda_{min}$
