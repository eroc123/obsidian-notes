- At the heart of a piezoelectric transducer is a piezoelectric crystal

##### E.M.F production
- materials which produce an [[obsidian-notes/Physics/9 - Electricity/Potential DIfference|e.m.f]] when they are deformed
	- deformation can be by compression or stretching
	- 
##### Mechanical Force producion
- if a p.d. is applied to a piezoelectric crystal, then it deforms, and if p.d. is reversed, then it expands.
	- If this is an [[Alternating Current Definition|alternating p.d.]] then the crystal will vibrate at the same frequency as the alternating voltage
	- must be cut to a certain size to induce [[resonance]] 

##### Quartz - piezoelectric crystals
-  made up of a lattice of silicon dioxide atoms
- When the lattice is distorted, structure becomes charged, creating an electric field and, as a result, an electric current
- If an electric current (a.c. current) is applied to the crystal, then this causes the shape of the lattice to alternate, producing a sound wave
- Due to conventional direction of electrical current, it flows from the positive to the negative region of the crystal

##### Applications
- microphone 
	- piezoelectric microphone detects pressure variations in sound wave
	- can be converted into electrical signal for further processing
- Ultrasound
	- in a [[piezoelectric transducer]], an alternating p.d. is applied to produce ultrasound waves and sent into the patient's body
	- returning ultrasound waves induce a p.d. in the transducer for analysis by a healthcare professional.
