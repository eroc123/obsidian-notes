- use an [[Ultrasound and ultrasound device]] to create image
- transducer sends out a beam of sound waves into the body
- sound waves are reflected back to the transducer by boundaries between tissues and the path of the beam
	- boundary between fluid and soft tissue or soft tissue and bone
- when the echos hit the transducer, they generate electrical signals which are sent to the ultrasound scanner
- Using the speed of sound and the time of the echo's return, the scanner calculates the distance from the transducer to the tissue boundary - use [[Physics/3 - Dynamics/Terminal Velocity|s=d/t]]
- these distances can be used to generate two-dimensional  images of tissues and organs
- Frequncy of ultrasound is important 
	- the higher the frequency, the higher the resolution and smaller structures can be distinguished


##### Information provided by ultrasound
- depth - distance from ultrasound transducer to tissue boundary
- nature - intensity of ultrasound waves recieved - basically how much of the ultrasound waves echoed off that specific boundary
