- when more comprehensive images are needed, a computerised axial tomography (CT or CAT) scan is used
- main features:
	- X-ray tube rotates around the stationary patient
	- CT scanner takes X-ray images of the same slice, at many different angles
	- Process is repeated, then images of successive slices are combined together
	- Computer pieces the images together to build a 3D image
	- 3D image can be rotated and viewed from different angles


##### Advantages
- produce much more detailed images
- can distinguish between tissues with similar attenuation coefficients
- produces a 3D image of the body by combining the images at each direction


##### Disadvantages
- patient recieves a much higher dose than a normal X-ray
- possible side effects from the contrast media.
