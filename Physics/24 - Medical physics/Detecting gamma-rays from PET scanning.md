- patient lies in a stationary tube surrounded by a ring of detectors
- images of slices of body taken to show position of [[radioactive tracers]] 
- consists of two parts:
	- Crystal Scintillator - when gamma-ray photon is incident on a crystal, an electron in the crystal is [[absorption spectra|excited to a higher energy state]]
		- As the excited electron travels through the crystal, it excites more electrons
		- When excited electrons [[Physics/22 - Quantum Physics/emission spectra|move back down to their original state]], the lost energy is transmitted as visible light particles
	- Photomultipler - Photons produced by the scintillator are very faint, hence they must be amplified and converted to an electric signal by a photomultiplier tube
	

##### Calculate energy of gamma-ray photons
- momentum formula for photons is $p = E/c$ where c is speed of light and E is energy ($E=mc^2$ )


##### Creating an image from PET scanning
- gamma rays travel in straight lines in opposite directions to conserve momentum when formed from positron-electron emission
- hit detectors in a line - known as line of response
- Tracers emit lots of gamma rays simultaneously, computers will use this info to create an image
- More photons from a particular point, the more tracer that is present in the tissue being studied, and will appear as a bright point on the image
- An image of the tracer concentration in the tissue can be creating by processing the arrival times of the gamma-ray photons
