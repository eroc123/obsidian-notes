- Definition: A substance containing [[Radioactive Decay|radioactive nuclei]] that is introduced to the body and can be absorbed by tissue to study the structure and function of organs in the body.
- Radioactive isotopes such as technetium-99m or flourine-18 are suitable for this purpose
	- they both bind to organic molecules, such as glucose or water, which are readily avaliable in the body
	- They both emit gamma radiation and decay into stable isotopes
	- Technetium-99m has a short [[Half life definition|half-life]] of 6 hours
	- Fluroine-18 has an even shorter half life of 110 minutes, so patient is exposed to radiation for a shorter time

##### Using tracers in PET scanning
- A type of nuclear medical procedure that images tissues and organs by measuring the metabolic activity of the cells of body tissues
- common tracer used in PET scanning is a glucose molecule with radioactive fluorine attached called fluorodeoxyglucose
- undergoes $\beta +$ decay - emitting a positron 
- tracer is injected or swallowed into patient and flows around body
- Once tissues and organs have absorbed the tracer, they appear on the screen as a bright area for diagnosis
	- allows doctors to determine progress of a disease and how effective any treatments have been
- tracers are not only used for the diagnosis of cancer but also for the heart and detecting areas of decreased blood flow and brain injuries, including Alzheimers and demetia
