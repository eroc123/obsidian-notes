- Electrical devices used to store energy in electronic circuits
- **Two forms:**
	- Isolated spherical conductor
	- Parallel plates

- Marked with a value of their **capacitance** which is defined as:
	- **Charge stored per unit potential difference** (C/V) 
	- Higher capacitance = greater stored energy in capacitor.
	- Parallel plate capacitor is made of two conductive metal plates connected to voltage supply.
		- Negative terminal of voltage supply pushes electrons onto one plate
		- Electrons repelled from opposite plate, making it positively charged 
		- Dielectric is placed between plates - ensures charge doesn't flow freely
			- Dielectric is just a material which is a poor conductor of electricity but good conductor of electric fields.

##### Capacitance Formula
$C = Q/V$
measured in Farad (F)
F is a very large unit, so usually
