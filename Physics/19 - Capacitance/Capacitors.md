- Electrical devices used to store energy in electronic circuits
- **Two forms:**
	- Isolated spherical conductor
	- Parallel plates

- Marked with a value of their **capacitance** which is defined as:
	- **Charge stored per unit potential difference** (C/V) 
	- Higher capacitance = greater stored energy in capacitor.
	- Parallel plate capacitor is made of two conductive metal plates connected to voltage supply.
