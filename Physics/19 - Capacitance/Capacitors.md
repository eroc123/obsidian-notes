- Electrical devices used to store energy in electronic circuits
- **Two forms:**
	- Isolated spherical conductor
	- Parallel plates

- Marked with a value of their **capacitance** which is defined as:
	- **Charge stored per unit potential difference** (C/V) 
	- Higher capacitance = greater stored energy in capacitor.
	- Parallel plate capacitor is made of two conductive metal plates connected to voltage supply.
		- Negative terminal of voltage supply pushes electrons onto one plate
		- Electrons repelled from opposite plate, making it positively charged 
		- Dielectric is placed between plates - ensures charge doesn't flow freely
			- Dielectric is just a material which is a poor conductor of electricity but good conductor of electric fields.

##### Capacitance Formula (two parallel conductors)
$C = Q/V$
- measured in Farad (F)
- F is a very large unit, so usually microfarads, nano-farads or picoFarads are used.
- Defined as ratio of charge on an object to its potential.
- If capacitor made of parallel plates, charge Q is the charge on the plates and V is the potential difference across the capacitor

##### Capacitance Formula (spherical conductor)
- Capacitance of a charged sphere - defined by the charge per unit potential at the surface of the sphere.
- Potential V is defined by the potential of an isolated point charge $V=Q/4\pi\epsilon_0 r$ 
- substitute into capacitance and you get $C=4\pi \epsilon_0 r$
