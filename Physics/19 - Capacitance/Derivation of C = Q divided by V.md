Circuit symbol for parallel plate is two parallel lines: ![[Capacitor]]
- Capacitors can be combined in both series and parallel
- Combined [[capacitors|capacitance]] depends on whether the capacitors are connected in series or parallel
##### In series
- Capacitors in series each have different potential differences across each capacitor but same charge. 
	- $V_T = V_1 + V_2$ 
	- $C_1 = Q/V_1$ 
	- $C_T = Q/C_1 + Q
