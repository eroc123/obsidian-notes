- When charging a capacitor, power supply pushes electrons from positive to negative plate. 
- Does **work on electrons**, increasing their **electric potential energy**
- Initially, a small amount of charge builds up at the negative plate, so there is relatively little repulsion.
- As charge increases on the negative plate, force of repulsion between the electrons on the plate and the new electrons increase. 
	- This means a greater amount of work must be done to increase charge.

##### Graph
Charge is directly proportional to Voltage
- capacitance formula Q= VC where C is constant
- hence the graph is a straight line through the origin. 
- [[Electrical potential energy]] stored in the capacitor can be determined from the **area under the potential-charge graph** - equal to area of right angled triangle.
