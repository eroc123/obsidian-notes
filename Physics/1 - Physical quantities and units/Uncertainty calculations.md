- Uncertainty could be thought of as the difference between the **measured value** and the **true value**
- Can be written using $+-$ which essentially states the possible deviation from the measured value. e.g. $+-2$ means that the **true value** can deviate by up to two away from the **measured value**



#### Types of uncertainty
- **Absolute uncertainty**: fixed quanity such as 2
- **Percentage uncertainty**: a percentage of a measurement (e.g. 2%)
	- Calculated by dividing the **absolute uncertainty** by the **value** and then **multiplying 100**
- **Fractional uncertainty**: a fraction of a measurement (e.g. $1/2$)

#### Uncertainty in different situations
- Uncertainty of an **analogue** instrument is half the smallest division of the instrument.
	- e.g. $1mm$ is the smallest division, therefore the **absolute uncertainty** is +-0.5mm
- Uncertainty of a **digital** instrument is equivalent to the smallest division
	- - e.g. $1mm$ is the smallest division, therefore the **absolute uncertainty** is +- 1mm

#### Arithmetic with uncertainty
- Combining values (add/subtract): add together absolute uncertainties
- Multiplying/diving data: add together percentage uncertainties
- Raising to a power: multiply fractional or percentage uncertainty by power.

##### Calculating absolute uncertainty of multiple values
n trials of quantity x leads to distribution of values (x1, x2, x3,…)

$\text{Average value} = { \text{sum of all measurements} \over \text{number of measurements}}$

$\text{Absolute uncertainty } \Delta x = {range \over 2} = {x_{max} - x_{min} \over 2}$

Don’t forget that each individual measurement has readability uncertainty
