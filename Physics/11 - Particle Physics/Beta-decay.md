A neutron (2 down quarks and an up quark)
One of the down quarks changes flavour to an up quark. The down quark has a charge of -1/3 and the up quark has a charge of 2/3 so a virtual $W^-$ boson (a particle associated with the weak force) is needed, which carries away a (-1) charge (conserving charge)
The new up quark bouces back because of conservation of momentum and we hnow have a proton (2 ups and a down)
The $W^-$ splits into an electron and an anti neuutrino (both leptons)
All three new particles: The proton, the electron and the antieutrino move away from each other, conserving  momentum
