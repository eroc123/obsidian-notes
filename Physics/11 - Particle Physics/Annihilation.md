- If a particle and its corresponding antiparticle meet they annihilate. 
- All mass gets converted to energy - produce gamma rays
- The energy of a photon = $h*f=E$
- E = Plank's constant x frequency
- $m_0$ means particle with 0 momentum (stationary)


#### Pair production
- a photon creates a particle and corresponding anti-particle (usually $e^{+1}$ and $e^{-1}$)
- Only occurs if one photon has **exactly** the energy required to produce total rest mass of two particles
- Minimum energy of photon needed = $hf_{min} = 2F_0$
- $F_{min}$ is the minimum photon frequency required, $F_0$ is the rest mass energy of the particles
