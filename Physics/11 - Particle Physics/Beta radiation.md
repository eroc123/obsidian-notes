- Neutron rich nuclei tend to decay by beta minus (b-) emission
- Beta particle is a **high-speed electron** ejected from the **nucleus, not electron cloud**
- It is formed by the decay of neutrons, which are slightly more energetic than a proton
- Isolated protons are stable, isolated neutrons last 10 minutes
![[beta minus decay]]

- Neutron emits a high speed electron, gets converted to a proton and the proton number  of the nuclide goes up by 1.
- **Decay produces isotope, electron, antineutrino, gamma photon**
- Energy released usually shared among nucleus, electron and the antineutrino.
- Antineutrino has a tiny mass, highly penetrating and get gets eliminated immediately.
