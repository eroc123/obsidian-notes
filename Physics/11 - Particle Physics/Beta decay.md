A neutron (2 down quarks and an up quark)

One of the down quarks changes [[quarks|flavor]] to an up quark. 

The down quark has a charge of -1/3 and the up quark has a charge of 2/3 so a virtual $W^-$ boson (a particle associated with the weak force) is needed, which carries away a (-1) charge (conserving charge)

The new up quark bouces back because of conservation of momentum and we now have a proton (2 ups and a down)
The $W^-$ splits into an electron and an anti antineutrino (both leptons)

All three new particles: The proton, the electron and the antineutrino move away from each other, conserving  momentum
