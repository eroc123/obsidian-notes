**Hadrons:** baryons (proton, neutron) and antibaryons (antiproton and antineutron) and mesons (pion, kaon) - are made up of quarks (not fundamental)
**Hadrons:** Hadrons are subject to strong nuclear force
**Proton:** Only stable baryon which all other baryons eventually decay. Decay of neutron should be known
**Leptons:** Electron, muon, neutrino (fundamental particles)
**Leptons:** Subject to weak interaction
**Baryon numbers for the hadrons. Lepton numbers for the leptons are provided in data booklet**
