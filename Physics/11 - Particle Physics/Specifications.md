**Hadrons:** baryons (proton, neutron) and anti-baryons (antiproton and antineutron) and mesons (pion, kaon) - are made up of quarks (not fundamental)
- Baryons are those which eventually contain protons in their decay products (protons most stable)
- Those which do not include protons in their decay products (Mesons)
**Hadrons:** Hadrons are subject to strong nuclear force
- heavy
- subject to electromagnetic force if charged
**Proton:** Only stable baryon which all other baryons eventually decay. Decay of neutron should be known
**Leptons:** Electron, muon, neutrino (fundamental particles)
- light
- not subject to strong interaction
- subject to electromagnetic force if charged
**Leptons:** Subject to weak interaction
**Baryon numbers for the hadrons. Lepton numbers for the leptons are provided in data booklet**

- Assigning numbers - If a particle is a baryon, the baryon number is +1, if its an antiparticle the number is -1, if the particle is not a baryon then its 0.
- Same system with leptons.
- Baryon and lepton number conserved in decay
