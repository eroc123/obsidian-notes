Alpha particles were considered to be nuclear sized bullets that would smash the atoms in the gold foil like water melons.

Instead they found that many alpha particles were deflected, while a few came back in the direction they came from. It led to some important conclusions:

There is a positively charged nucleus

The nucleus is very tiny compared with the rest of the atom, most of the atom is just empty space.

The radius of the nucleus was in the order of 3 x 10-14 m.

The alpha particles that were deflected back had to be travelling in a line with the nucleus

The nucleus is very small compared to the atom, about 10 000 times smaller. The diameter of an atom is in the order of 10-10 m, whereas the diameter of the nucleus in the order of 10-15 m.

The atom is a very dynamic entity. The diagram shows a stylised representation; the reality is that there is absolute bedlam at the atomic level.
