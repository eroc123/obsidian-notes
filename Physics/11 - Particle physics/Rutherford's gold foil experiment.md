Alpha particles were considered to be nuclear sized bullets that would smash the atoms in the gold foil like water melons.

Instead they found that many alpha particles were deflected, while a few came back in the direction they came from. It led to some important conclusions:

There is a positively charged nucleus

The nucleus is very tiny compared with the rest of the atom, most of the atom is just empty space.

The radius of the nucleus was in the order of 3 x 10-14 m.

The alpha particles that were deflected back had to be travelling in a line with the nucleus
