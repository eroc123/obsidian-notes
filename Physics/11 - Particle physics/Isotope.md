Atoms with the same number of protons and different numbers of neutrons
<font> $^A_ZX$

A - Nucleon number, or the mass number. Total number of nucleons
Z - Proton number or atomic number. 
X - Chemical symbol

## Notation
- We can determine the number of neutrons simply by subtracting the proton number from the nucleon number
- Isotopes have the same numbers of protons, but different numbers of neutrons
- Isotopes have the same physical and chemical properties
- If the proton number is altered, the element changes
- Some isotopes are radioactive, as the nuclei are unstable
