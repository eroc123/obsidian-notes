Atoms of the same element with same number of proton but different number of neutron
![[Drawing 2024-01-08 09.43.59.excalidraw.svg|100]]
A - Nucleon number, or the mass number. Total number of nucleons
Z - Proton number or atomic number. 
X - Chemical symbol 

## Notation
- We can determine the number of neutrons simply by subtracting the proton number from the nucleon number
- Isotopes have the same numbers of protons, but different numbers of neutrons
- Isotopes have the same physical and chemical properties
- If the proton number is altered, the element changes
- Some isotopes are radioactive, as the nuclei are unstable
