- Second derivation of [[obsidian-notes/Excalidraw/Displacement time graph|Displacement time graph]] 
- Gradient function of velocity.
- The shape of the graph shows that **acceleration is directly proportional and in the opposite direction to displacement.** Completely out of phase with each other.
- ![[Acceleration time graph drawing]]
- Formula for acceleration of oscillation: $a=-\omega^2 x_0 sin (\omega t)$  
- substitute in definition for displacement $x = x_0 sin(\omega t)$ 
- you get the original definition of [[Simple Harmonic Oscillations]] of $a = -\omega ^2 x$
