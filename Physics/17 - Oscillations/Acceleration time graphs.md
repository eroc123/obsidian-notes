- Second derivation of [[obsidian-notes/Excalidraw/Displacement time graph|Displacement time graph]] 
- Gradient function of velocity.
- The shape of the graph shows that **acceleration is directly proportional and in the opposite direction to displacement.** Completely out of phase with each other.
