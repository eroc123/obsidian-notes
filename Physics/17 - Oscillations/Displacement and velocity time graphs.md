- Graph shape can be described by this equation:
	- $x=x_0 sin(\omega t)$
	- where x is displacement, $x_0$ (A) is amplitude and $\omega$ is the angular frequency. 
	- Is a **solution** to the equation defining [[Simple Harmonic Oscillations|harmonic oscillator]] $a=-\omega^2 x$

##### Velocity time graph
- Velocity is first derivative of displacement.
- $v=v_0 cos(\omega t)$  $v_0$ is equal to $\omega A/\omega x_0$
