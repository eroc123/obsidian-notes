- System experiences external driving force, causing system to oscillate. 
- **Frequency of the driving force** is called **driving frequency.**
- If **driving frequency** is equal to **natural frequency of a system** (resonant frequency), **resonance occurs**
	- During resonance, amplitude of oscillations increases drastically, since the system gains energy. Think of resonance as adding energy perfectly as the oscillation reaches max displacement, increasing displacement even more.

##### Useful cases for resonance
- Radio - tuned so electric circuit resonates at same frequency as broadcast frequency
- Instruments - flute has a long tube which air resonates, causing a stationary sound wave to be formed.

##### Undesirable use cases for resonance
- Bridges - When people drive across a bridge, there may be a chance for their driving force to be equal to the natural frequency of the bridge, causing large oscillations from resonance. May cause damage
- Aircraft - same reason.

##### Reduce resonance
- use [[Damping]] 
- when used:
	- resonant frequency decreases, 
	- max amplitude decreases,
	- peak of amplitude becomes wider. 
- the **sharpness** of resonance decreases as **degree of damping** increases.
