- System experiences external driving force, causing system to oscillate. 
- **Frequency of the driving force** is called **driving frequency.**
- If **driving frequency** is equal to **natural frequency of a system** (resonant frequency), **resonance occurs**
	- During resonance, amplitude of oscillations increases drastically, since the system gains energy. Think of resonance as adding energy perfectly as the oscillation reaches max displacement, increasing displacement even more.
