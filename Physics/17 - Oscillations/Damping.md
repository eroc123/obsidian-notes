- **Damping** is where energy in an oscillating system is lost to the environment, leading to reduced amplitude of oscillations.

##### Light damping
- Under-damping - where amplitude gradually decreases by a small amount each oscillation
	- Example: pendulum experiencing air resistance (each swing slows the pendulum)
	- Amplitude of oscillations follows exponential decay. 

##### Critical damping
- Reduce amplitude to 0 in smallest amount of time possible (no oscillation)
	- Example: used in shock absorbers - allow oscillations experienced by a car suspension to be critically damped, making car control much easier. Also used in **measurement** instruments e.g. speedometers so pointers dont oscillate. 

##### Heavy damping
- over-damping, amplitude reduces slower than with critical damping, but also with no oscillations (just slow critical damping basically)
	- Door closer - allows a door to slowly close without oscillating.
	- Door can close slowly without oscillating
