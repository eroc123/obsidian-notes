- [[Simple Harmonic Oscillations]] do not lose energy. [[Physics/5 - Work, energy and power/Energy Conservation|Energy is conserved.]] Hence as it oscillates, kinetic energy gets transferred to potential and back to kinetic. Type of potential energy depends on system.
- At the amplitude of oscillations, system will have maximum amount of potential energy. As it moves towards equilibrium position, potential energy gets converted to kinetic energy such that **at the center of oscillations** the **kinetic energy is at a a maximum.** When the system moves away from equilibrium, kinetic energy gets transferred back to potential and repeat for one full oscillation.
