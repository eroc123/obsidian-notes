**Free oscillations** - When no external forces is continuously acting on the system, so its energy remains constant.
- Oscillate at **natural frequency**
- e.g simple pendulum, mass spring system, tuning fork

###### Simple harmonic motion
- Object experiences this when acceleration is **directly proportional** to its **displacement and is in the opposite direction**
- Formula:
	- $a=-\omega^2x$ where x is displacement and a is acceleration. $\omega$ is angular speed.
