Question 1. **Planning** Skill\[15\]

- Define the problem and identify key variables
	- Identify i**ndependent variables** (variable to change - cause)
		- Mass of the vehicle (use slotted masses)
	- Identify **dependent variables** (variable to study - effect)
		- The velocity of the vehicle right after the ball hits
	- Identify **constant variables** (variables that do not change)
		- The compression of the spring, 
		- the spring constant of the spring, 
		- the mass of the ball. 
		- Type of vehicle 
		- The initial velocity of the vehicle
- Describe the method of data collection
	- To vary the independent variable: use set slotted masses at set intervals, e.g. 100g. Stick a mass hanger onto the vehicle and add one slotted mass after each previous reading.
	- To measure the independent variable: 
		- We can place the front of the trolley up against a reference point on the track (e.g. a painted line). 
		- We then use a stopwatch to measure the time taken for the front of the trolley to pass a second reference point (another painted line in the back) or reach the end of the track. 
		- The stopwatch is started when the ball hits the vehicle and stopped when the vehicle passes the end of the track.
	- How to keep other variables constant: 
		- Use the same ball
		- use the same spring
		- compress the spring by a set distance OR until the spring reaches a set force (use a newton meter)
- Describe the method of analysis
	- 
- Identify any additional details, including safety considerations.
	- risks: ball might fly into eye if not being careful - ball goes fast after being launched from a spring
	- risks: vehicle might run over your finger 
There are set mark schemes.
