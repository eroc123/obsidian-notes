**Phase difference:** Given point on one wave lags behind the exact same point on another wave

Expressed in angle in either degrees or radians (1 whole cycle is 360 degrees or 
$2\pi$ radians

**Formula**
$2 \pi d/\lambda$ = Phase difference (in radians)
- **Applies only to waves of**
	- Same frequency
	- Same wavelength

If phase difference is $pi$, it is called antiphase.
