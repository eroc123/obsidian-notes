Averaging all possible [[Polarization|polarisation]] directions, exactly 1/2 of the light passes through the polariser. 

For an initial [[intensity]] $I_i$ passes through a polarizer, the transmitted or final, intensity, $I_f = {1 \over 2} I_i$

Polarizer effects both the intensity and the polarization of a beam of light

when the second polarizer is rotated at an angle of $\theta$ we can use the formula $I_f = I_i cos^2\theta$ 

The angle theta is the angle of the slit compared to the orginal slit angle
