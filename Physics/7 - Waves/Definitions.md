**Displacement**: Distance and direction from the equilibrium position (base line/halfway point)
**Amplitude**: Maximum displacement. For a transverse wave it is the maximum height of the wave crest or trough. Can be thought of in terms of energy, power, volume  or loudness.
**Wavelength**: Distance in metres between the same point on two successive waves.
**Crest**: Top of wave is called the crest
**Trough**: Bottom of the wave
**Frequency:** The number of complete oscillations per unit of time in Hz (waves per second or $s^{-1}$)
**Period:** The time it takes for one full cycle or oscillation of a wave($1/f$ and measured in seconds)
**Velocity:** Distance travelled by wave per unit time. Measured in ($ms^{-1}$)
**Progressive waves:** Waves that transfer energy 
**Stationary waves:** Waves that do not transfer energy
