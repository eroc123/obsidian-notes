## Moving source
- When the source of the sound is moving relative to the observer, the observed frequency is different from the true frequency
![[Physics/Excalidraw/doppler effect|100%]]

$$f_0 = f_s({V \over V \pm V_s})$$
- $f_o$ is observed frequency
- $f_s$ is source frequency - frequency of the sound emitted by the source
- $V$ is wave velocity 
- $V_s$ is the velocity of the moving object relative to the observer
	- If away, velocity is positive
	- If towards, velocity is negative

$v \Delta t - u_s \Delta t$
Distance moved by waves minus distance moved by source

$$\lambda_n = {\text{distance occupied by waves} \over \text{number of waves}}$$
$$\lambda_n = {v \Delta t - u_s \Delta t \over f \Delta t}$$
$$\lambda_n = {(v - u_s) \over f}$$
$$\lambda_n = 1/f_n$$
rearranging to get the same formula $$f_0 = f_s({V \over V \pm V_s})$$


## Moving observer

$$\lambda = v/f$$
$$v + u_0 = f_n \lambda = f_n \times {v \over f}$$
$$f_n = (1 + {u_0 \over v}) f$$
