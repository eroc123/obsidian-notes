Light is also subject to the doppler effect

Stars moving toward the Earth have their light wavelengths shortened

Stars moving away form the Earth have their light wavelengths lengthened

Light given off by a star contains gaps called absorption lines

The absorption lines can be seen after the light from a star passes through a diffraction grating

The lines are caused by the elements absorbing those light frequencies

Depending on the position of the absorption lines, we can deduce the chemical makeup of the star, as well as how old it is, the temperature, and the distance

Red shift - moving away
Blue shift - moving closer
