The intensity of a waves is the rate of energy transmitted per unit area at right angles to the wave velocity
$$Intensity = {Power \over area}$$
Unit: $Wm^{-2}$


The intensity of a waves generally decreases as it travels
- The wave may spread out
- The wave may be absorbed or scattered ( as when light passes through the earths atmosphere)

As the wave spreads out, its amplitude decreases. 
This suggests that the intensity of a wave is related to its amplitude
$$Intensity \propto Amplitude^2$$
$$Intensity = Constant \times Amplitude^2$$
