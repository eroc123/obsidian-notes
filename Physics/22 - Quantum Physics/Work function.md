- energy is conserved - energy of an incident photon 
	- Threshold energy + kinetic energy of the photoelectron
- Energy within a photon is equal to hf
- Energy within the photon is transferred to the electron to release it from the electron well (release from metal) and the rest of it is turned into kinetic energy. 
	- **Photoelectric equation**
	- $E = hf = \phi + 1/2 mv^2$ 
- h is plancks constant
- f is the frequency of the incident radiation
- $\phi$ is the work function of the material
- $1/2 mv^2$ is the maximum kinetic energy of the photons
- $E_{kmax}$ depends only on the frequency of the incident photon, not the intensity of the radiation.
- Majority of photoelectrons have kinetic energies less than $E_{kmax}$
