- electrons travel through space as a wave
- must hold properties like [[obsidian-notes/Physics/7 - Waves/Wavelength|Wavelength]], because it acts as a wave
	- wavelength is the de Brogile wavelength
	- also must show properties like [[obsidian-notes/Physics/8 - Superposition/Diffraction|Diffraction]]
	- defined as: **The wavelength associated with a moving particle**
	- typical de Brogile wavelength is around 10nm, hence it is too small to view quantum effects for most everyday objects.
	- width of sample must be around 10nm to view quantum mechanical effects
- The electron diffraction tube can be used to investigate how the wavelength of electrons depends on their speed
    - The smaller the radius of the rings, the smaller the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons
##### Change voltage 
- increase voltage, increase energy of electron [[obsidian-notes/Physics/9 - Electricity/Potential DIfference|Potential DIfference]]
- radius of diffraction pattern decreases 
- shows as [[Velocity selection|speed]] of the electrons increase, the de Brogile wavelength decreases. according to [[obsidian-notes/Physics/7 - Waves/Waves|wave formula]] $v = f\lambda$ - frequency stays the same.
