+ Used to explain why low frequency sources couldn't liberate electrons
+ Threshold frequency is described as:
	+ The minimum frequency of incident electromagnetic radiation required to remove a photoelectron from the surface of a metal
##### Threshold Wavelength
- The longest wavelength of incident electromagnetic radiation that would remove a photoelectron from the surface of a metal
- basically same as threshold frequency except inverted as according to the [[Physics/7 - Waves/Equation for waves|Equation for waves]]
