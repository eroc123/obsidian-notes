- A diffraction pattern is produced when a beam of electrons is directed at a thin graphite film

-  electron [[diffraction]] can only be observed when being focused through a gap of similar size to electron.
	- e.g. atomic lattice
	- Graphite film is ideal - because of crystalline structure
	- Gaps between neighboring planes of atoms act as slits and allow diffraction
	- observed as a series of concentric rings
	- similar to light [[Physics/8 - Superposition/Diffraction|Diffraction]]
	- If electrons act as particles, a pattern would not be observed, insdead they would be distributed uniformly across the screen.
	- Larger accelerating voltage reduces diameter of a given ring, smaller accelerating voltage increases diameter of a given ring.

##### Electron diffraction observation
- Electron tubes are used to investigate wave properties of electrons
- Accelerated in an electron gun to high potential (e.g. 5000V) and shot through a thin granite film
- Electron diffract from gaps between carbon atoms and produce circular pattern on a fluorescent screen made from phosphor
- Electrons accelerated from cathode (negative) to anode (positive) before being diffracted through thin granite film
- ##### KE:
	- $E_k = 1/2mv^2=eV$ - see [[Electron Volt]] 
	-  _E_k = kinetic energy (J)
	- _m_ = mass (kg)
	- _v_ = velocity (m s–1)
	- _e_ = charge of an electron (1.60 × 10–19 J)
	- _V_ = potential difference (V)
