- occurs when excited atoms emit certain wavelengths of light - correspond to different colours
- Emitted light can be observed as a series of coloured lines with dark spaces in between
	- called line or atomic spectra
- no two elements release the same set of spectral lines - elements can be identified by line spectrum
- two types of line spectra: [[Physics/22 - Quantum Physics/emission spectra|emission]] and [[|absorption spectra|absorption]]
	- emission is the light that an atom absorbs
