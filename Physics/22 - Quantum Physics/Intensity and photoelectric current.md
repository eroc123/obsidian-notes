### Kinetic Energy & Intensity
- Kinetic energy of photoelectron is independent of the intensity of the incident radiation
- Because each electron can only absorb one photon
- Kinetic energy is only dependent on the frequency of the incident radiation
- Intensity measures the number of photons incident on the surface of the metal
- Increasing the number of photons striking the metal will not increase kinetic energy, it will increase the number of photoelectrons emitted

##### Why kinetic energy varies (why its a maximum)
- Each electron in the metal acquires the same amount of energy from the photons in incident radiation
- However, the energy required to remove an electron from the metal varies because some electrons are on the surface whilst others are deeper in the material.
	- Photoelectrons with the maximum kinetic energy will be those on the surface of the metal since they dont need a lot of energy to leave the metal
	- Photoelectrons released from deeper within the metal will have less kinetic energy since some of the energy absorbed from the photon is used by the electron to approach the metal's surface
	- Less kinetic energy avaliable for photoelectrons once they ahve left the metal.
##### Photoelectric current
- Current defined as flow of charge - photoelectrons
- photoelectric current defined as number of electrons released per second
- Photoelectric current is **proportional to** the intensity, as the higher the intensity, the more electrons are knocked out their well

- _**Kinetic energy of photoelectrons is independent of intensity, whereas the photoelectric current is proportional to intensity and independent of frequency**_
