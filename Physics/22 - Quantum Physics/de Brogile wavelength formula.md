[[obsidian-notes/Physics/3 - Dynamics/Momentum|Momentum]] p of particle and associated wavelength $\lambda$ are related by equation
$\lambda = h/p$
- this uses ideas of quantum theory and Einsteins theory of relativity
- where h is plancks constant
- p = mv substitute this in
- $\lambda = h/mv$ 

- Kinetic energy $E=1/2 mv^2$ 
- momentum and energy are related by $E=p^2/2m$ or $p=\sqrt(2Em)$
- sub in for de Brogile wavelength $\lambda = h/\sqrt(2Em)$
