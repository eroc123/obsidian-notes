- Unit used to express very small energies - usually energies in quantum mechanics are very small

##### Derivation
- $V=E/Q$ where V is [[potential difference]], E is energy and Q is charge.
- When an electron travels through a potential difference, energy is transferred between two points in a circuit or electric field.
- Electron has a charge of $1.6 * 10^{-19}C$, when an electron travels through one volt in an electric field or circuit, energy transferred is $E= QV = (1.60*10^{-19}$ C * 1V) = $1.60 * 10^{-19}J$
Electron volt is defined as: The energy gained by an electron travelling through a potential difference of 1 volt.

e is the charge of one electron
V is potential difference
m is mass of particle
v is velocity of particle

$eV = 1/2 mv^2$

Rearrange to get speed of equation
$v = \sqrt (2eV/m)$
