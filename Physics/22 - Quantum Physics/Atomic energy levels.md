- Electrons in atoms can only have certain discrete energies
	- energies called electron energy levels
- Series of stacked horizontal lines increasing in energy
- **ground state:** lowest energy level avaliable - this is what electrons normally occupy
- electrons can gain energy and move up energy levels if they absorb energy
	- colliding with other atoms/electrons
	- [[Photoelectric effect|absorbing a photon]]
	- Physical source of energy, e.g. heat
- **Excitation** - electrons move up an energy level and get excited
- if they gain enough energy to be removed from the atom completely, it gets **ionized** 
- if an atom returns to a lower energy state, they release a photon (conservation of energy)

- values are negative similar to [[Gravitational Potential]] where the highest energy level is 0 [[Electron Volt|eV]] and lower values are negative. Basically its the amount of energy required to escape an atom.
