- Work function $\phi$ or threshold energy of a material is defined as:
	- The minimum energy required to release a photoelectron from the surface of a metal
	- since its energy, units are J
- single electron can only absorb one photon, therefore the photon must have the energy $\phi$ or higher to knock the electron out and allow it to escape.
- consider each electron as being trapped in an energy well - energy between surface and the top of the well is $\phi$ 

##### Work function
- since different materials have different [[Threshold Frequency|threshold frequencies]] 
	- the more tightly bound electron requires more energy to reach the top of the well
	- less tightly bound electrons require less energy to reach the top of the well

- **In the photoelectric effect, a single photon may cause a surface electron if it has sufficient energy**

- Alkali metals e.g. potassium have lower threshold frequencies (in visible light range) because the attractive forces between electrons and positive metal ions is weak
- Transition metals e.g. manganese and iron, have threshold frequencies in ultraviolet region
	- Frequency is much higher than in visible light region
	- Attractive forces between surface and positive ions is much stronger
