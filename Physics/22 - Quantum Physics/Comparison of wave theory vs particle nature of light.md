#### Wave Theory of light suggests
1. Any frequency of light can give rise to photoelectric emission
	1. Photoelectrons will be released immediately if the frequency is above the threshold for that metal
2. Energy absorbed by each electron will gradually increase with each wave
	1. Energy is absorbed instantaneously - photoelectron are either emitted or not emitted after exposure to light
3. Kinetic energy of [[photoelectric emission|emitted electrons should be proportional to intensity]]
	1. If the intensity of the light is increased, more photoelectron are emitted per second
