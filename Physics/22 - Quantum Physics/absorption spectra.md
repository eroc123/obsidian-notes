- Atom raised to an excited state by the absorption of a photon
- white light passes through [[Gas laws|low-pressure]] gas, some light of certain wavelengths are missing
- is continuous unlike emission spectrum
	- all dark line spots are wavelengths of light which are absorbed by an atom. 
	- all coloured spots are wavelengths not absorbed
	- contains all colours with dark lines at certain lengths

	- Dark lines correspond exactly to the differences in energy levels in an atom. (basically)
	- you must have exactly enough energy required to excite an atom and make it jump from one energy level to another. If not exact, it doesnt absorb.
	- e.g. red arrow means red wavelength of light is absorbed to jump atom exactly from n=2 to n=3.
