Light waves can behave like particles as demonstrated by [[Photoelectric effect]]
Light propagates through space as a wave, as demonstrated by [[obsidian-notes/Physics/8 - Superposition/Young's Double Slit Experiment|youngs double slit experiment]] and also because it can diffract and interfere with other waves


##### Light as a Particle
- Einstein proposed that light can be described as a quanta of energy that behave as particles, called photons
- - The **photon model of light** explains that:
    - Electromagnetic waves carry energy in discrete packets called photons
    - The energy of the photons are quantised according to the equation [[Photon|E = hf]]
    - In the photoelectric effect, each electron can absorb only a single photon - this means only the frequencies of light above the [[threshold frequency]] will emit a photoelectron 

##### Wave Theory of Light
- Wave theory suggests any frequency of light can cause [[Photoelectric Emission]]
- Because energy absorbed by each electron gradually increases with each wave
- Also should suggest electron kinetic energy should increase with intensity. 
- photoelectric effect none of this is observed.

- Although the wave theory provided good explanations for phenomena such as interference and diffraction, it failed to explain the photoelectric effect
