- Phenomenan in which electrons are emitted from the surface of a metal upon the absorption of electromagnetic radiation
- Electrons removed from the metal are known as photoelectrons
- Important effect that light is [[Physics/22 - Quantum Physics/Photon|quantasized]] and not continuous
	- one electron can only absorb one photon
	- only frequencies of light above a threshold frequency will emit an electron


##### Observe photoelectric effect
 - Can be observed on a gold leaf electroscope
 - Plate of metal, usually zinc, is attached to a gold leaf. Initially has negative charge, causing it to be repelled by a central negatively charged rod.
	 - Causes electron buildup on the zinc plate
 - When UV light is shone onto the zinc plate adn gold leaf, the electrons become removed, causing the gold leaf to fall back to central rod. gold leaf = less charge

- Some notable observations:
    - Placing the UV light source closer to the metal plate causes the gold leaf to fall more quickly
    - Using a higher frequency light source does not change the how quickly the gold leaf falls
    - Using a filament light source causes no change in the gold leaf’s position
	    - Using a positively charged plate also causes no change in the gold leaf’s position
