**Suvat** stands for:
s: Displacement
u: Initial Velocity
v: Final Velocity
a: Acceleration
t: Time

### Suvat equations

- Equation 1: $v=u+at$ (when displacement is unknown)
- Equation 2: $s=1/2(u+v)t$ (when acceleration is unknown)
- Equation 3: $s=ut+1/2at^2$ (when final velocity is unknown)
- Equation 4: $v^2=u^2+2as$ (when time is unknown)
- Equation 5: $s=vt-1/2at^2$ (when initial velocity is unknown)
