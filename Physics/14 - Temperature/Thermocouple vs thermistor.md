| Sensitivity   | Dependent on the choice of the two metals - hence can be made very sensitive if needed                                                                               | Very sensitive but only over a narrow range of temperatures                                              |
| Range         | Large                                                                                                                                                                | Small                                                                                                    |
| Response time | Junctions are small, hence have lower thermal capacity, meaning shorter response time (takes less time to heat)                                                      | Are larger, meaning larger thermal capacity, taking longer to heat and hence have a longer response time |
| Stability     | Metals at the junction are subject to corrosion                                                                                                                      | Very stable - mostly unaffected by aging                                                                 |
| Ease of use   | Temp at reference junction must be kept stable, usually by using ice water which may make taking measurements awkward. More modern thermocouples do not need though. | Much easier to use.                                                                                      |
