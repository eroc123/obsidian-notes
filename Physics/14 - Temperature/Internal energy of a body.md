- Equal to the **sum of kinetic energies and potential energies of all its particles.** Kinetic and potential energies of particles are randomly distributed.

##### Change of state and change of internal energy (water used as example)
- Change of state causes change in internal energy.


###### Melting
- Temperature of ice increases until it hits 0 degrees C. Extra energy added is now used to **break bonds between water molecules** so that the state of water can change from ice to water. Temperature does not increase until bonds are broken and the ice has fully turned into liquid water
	- Causes increase in potential energy since added energy must go somewhere. It cannot contribute to the kinetic energy (temperature)  of particles since [[Kinetic energy of a molecule|kinetic energy of molecules is directly proportional to temperature]], hence it must increase potential energy
###### Boiling
- Temperature increases until 100 degrees C - where the same process occurs like during melting.
