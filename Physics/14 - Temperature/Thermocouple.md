- Structure:
- ![[Thermocouple diagram]]
- Measurement junction has a changing temperature (based on what is being measured)
- Reference junction is kept at a constant temperature ("reference")
- If there is a temperature difference, an [[Electromotive Force|emf]] is created which is measured by the voltmeter.
	- This works because a thermistor uses two dissimilar metals with different electrical properties, meaning that when the measurement junction is heated, an e.m.f is produced between the two dissimilar wires.

- Use a **callibration** curve (potential difference vs temperature) to calculate the temperature
