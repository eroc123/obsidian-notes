- **Kinetic model of matter** can be used to explain structure of solids liquids and gases (remember from GCSE??)
	- Matter is formed from **particles**
	- Particles can move
	- Particles experience **intermolecular forces**

##### Three basic states of matter

###### Solids:
- Particles are fixed but can vibrate because **intermolecular forces are large**
	- cannot be free basically
###### Liquids
- Particles have more energy and can flow around. Move more freely and slightly more separation between particles. **Weaker intermolecular forces than solids but still strong** 
	- Particles cannot separate far
###### Gases
- Particles are much further apart and can move and separate very freely because **intermolecular forces are very weak.**
	- can move around everywhere
