- Measure energy input into the material (Q) - calculate power input by multiplying [[power|current and voltage]] and multiplying the power by time it is turned on
- Measure change in mass of material - gain in mass when calculating latent heat or loss in mass when calculating latent heat of vaporisation.
	- Basically, when measuring latent heat of fusion, you catch all the melted liquid and measure the mass of the melted liquid. Just
