- Defined as **the amount of energy required to increase the temperature of 1 kg of substance by 1 degree C or K without changing its state.**
- Formula: $Q = mc\Delta \theta$
	- where Q is energy needed, m is mass, c is specific heat capacity and $\theta$ as the temperature.
	- Q in Joules
	- m in kg
	- $\theta$ in degrees C or K
