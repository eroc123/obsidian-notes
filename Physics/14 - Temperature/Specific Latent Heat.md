- **Definition:** Amount of energy required to change the state of 1 kg of material, without changing its temperature. Two types:
	- Specific latent heat of fusion - solid change to liquid
	- Specific latent heat of vaporisation - liquid to gas
- Energy required to change state of a substance:
	- $Q = ml$ Q is energy required and l specific latent heat

- Specific latent heat of vaporization is usually larger than the specific latent heat of fusion of the same substance as **more intermolecular bonds must be broken** when state changes from liquid to gas.
