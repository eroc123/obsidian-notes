- The kinetic energies of particles in a liquid are random (kinetic and potential energy are always randomly distributed inside a body)
- During evaporation, some particles in a liquid gain enough energy to leave the liquid, **leaving behind particles with lower kinetic energies** 
	- Hence the **kinetic energy of particles decreases** and since [[Kinetic energy of a molecule|temperature is proportional to kinetic energy,]] the temperature of the liquid will decrease.
		- this is how sweating works for example, since water particles evaporate, the sweat droplets on your skin cool down and hence they remove heat from your skin.
