- Measure the mass of the material that will be heated (m) - can use a top-pan balance
- Measure the energy input into the material (Q) by calculating power input by heater and multiplying by time that heater is turned on.
- Calculate temperature change - find difference between initial and final temperature.


##### Factors that may cause errors 
- Energy loss to environment may cause calculated heat capacity to be larger than true heat capacity
	- due to factors like heat loss to environment
	- maybe due to inefficiency of heater - not all energy is converted to heat.
	- reduce energy loss by insulating material.
