### Formation:

1. Waves attack a discordant coastline
2. Via hydraulic action, the coast gradually erodes, however, the soft bands of rock erode faster than the hard rock bands
3. The soft, less resistant rock bands get eroded away and form bays, whilst the hard, more resistant rock bands stick out and form headlands
4. Sheltered bays allow beaches to form from deposition

**Headlands:** Headlands cause waves to refract towards them, concentrating the waveâ€™s energy towards the headlands. This increases their erosive power, thus steepening the cliffs and accelerating the formation of stacks.

**Bays:** When waves enter a bay, they diffract, reducing the waves energy and erosive power and increasing the deposition rate, forming beaches.
