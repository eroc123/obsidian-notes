### Formation:
1. During the ice age, tectonic forces create folded ridges (anticlines) and valleys (syclines) parallel to the coast
2. Sea level rise at the end of the ice age flooded the synclines (valleys)
3. The folded ridges remain above water and turn into a line of islands that run parallel to the coast.
