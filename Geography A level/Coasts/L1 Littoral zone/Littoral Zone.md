### Littoral Zone:
- Another name for the coastal zone
- A dynamic area which is influenced by a lot of processes, both natural and human
- Can be divided into a number of zones
- Varies due to **short** and **long-term** factors such as:
	- **Short term:**
		- Waves 
		- Wind
		- Tides
		- Storms
	- **Long term:**
		- Climate change 
		- Sea level changes

### Processes: What can affect the shape and features of a coast?
- **Natural Processes:**
	- Sediment input from the sea and from rivers (via transport)
	- Constructive (via deposition) and destructive (via erosion) waves shaping coastlines (nearshore and foreshore zones)
	- Weathering (via erosion) affects backshore (outside wave influence)
	- Offshore wind and longshore drift can shift sediment (via transport)
- **Human Processes:**
	- Dredging of rivers
	- Dredging of offshore areas for gravel and sand
	- Construction of coastal defences
