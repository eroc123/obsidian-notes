Fig 2.9 - shows a diagram of the rock cycle

  
  

1. **Formation** - molten magma cools and forms igneous rocks
2. **Weathering and erosion** - rocks get broken down and transported by erosion
3. **Sediment deposition and compaction** - the pieces get transported and deposited in different places such as under lakes, where they build up and get compressed over time. This forms sedimentary rock
4. **Heat and pressure** - heat and pressure from the Earthâ€™s core or rich mineral flows alters the chemical composition and physical structure of the rocks, substantially changing them. This forms metamorphic rock
5. **Melting and cooling** - Intense heat causes the rocks to melt again, creating magma and restarting the cycle

|            | Igneous rocks                | Sedimentary rocks                                                                                                                             | Metamorphic rocks                       |                                   |

| Properties | Hard, resistant, impermeable | Jointed rocks are permeable (e.g. sandstone and limestone), rocks with air spaces are porous (chalk), compacted rocks (shale) are impermeable | Hard, resistant, inpermeable            |                                   |

*Note that unconsolidated rocks (e.g. boulder clay) are not resistant to erosion and thus easily eroded.
