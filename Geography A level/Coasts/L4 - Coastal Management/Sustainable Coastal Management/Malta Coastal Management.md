	- Allows for natural processes to take over
	- Allows for sea grass to pile up
**Why did they do it**
- In order to protect the beach environment for future generations 
- To allow tourists to still come into the area and contribute to the economy without degrading the environment
**How was it successful**
- It has won numerous awards such as the pretigous Blue Flag award.
	- Done when all 29 criteria set out by the FEE (Federation for Environmental Education) is met
**Conflict**
- There may be conflict between locals and tourists, since locals may want less tourists or even the full conservation of the beach (to preserve environment).
- Conflict between locals and businesses, where businesses may want to earn money and thus encourage tourism whilst locals may discourage tourism
- Conservationists may want full conservation of the beach and close it off to all visitors, whilst businesses and locals still want access to it.
