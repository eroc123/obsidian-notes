- The Earth's climate has changed throughout history and we can see these changes in the geological record. 
- However, recent climate changes are unprecedented and there is no longer any doubt that these increased temperatures are being caused by human activity. 
- We will continue to see warming temperatures until at least 2050 no matter what action we take, and some of the impacts will be irreversible for thousands of years.  
- Extreme weather events have become more frequent and intense. 
- Some development and adaptation efforts have reduced vulnerability, but the most vulnerable people and systems are disproportionately affected.
