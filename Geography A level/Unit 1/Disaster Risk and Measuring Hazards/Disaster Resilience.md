**Resilience **- the ability of a community to cope with a hazard
- Includes ability to prepare and recover from a disaster
- Determines disaster threshold (higher threshold if higher resillience)
**Examples of high resillience measures:**
- Have emergency evacuation, rescue and relief systems in place
- They react by helping each other to reduce numbers affected
- Hazard-resistant design or land -use planning to reduce the number of people at risk - e.g. zoning laws to keep people away from steep slopes or floodplains or aseismic design.
