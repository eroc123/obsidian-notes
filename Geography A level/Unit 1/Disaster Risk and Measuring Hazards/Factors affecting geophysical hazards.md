**Human:**
- Mitigation, e.g. engineering defenses
- Population density
- Level of development
- Architecture, well-built buildings
**Physical**
- Morphology of the coastline
- Geology, soft sediments more prone to soil liquefaction
- Natural characteristics of the hazard, e.g. proximity to settlements 
- Characteristics of magma, more viscosity = more buildup, hence more pressure buildup
- Climate - hazard in cold environments can cause avalanches
