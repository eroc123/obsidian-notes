**Population Total:**

- High population total increases vulnerability by intensifying the potential impact of disasters, overwhelming resources, and challenging effective emergency response.

**Population Density:**

- Greater population density elevates vulnerability as concentrated communities face amplified risks, increased strain on infrastructure, and heightened difficulties in evacuation and resource allocation.

**Population Structure:**

- Vulnerability is influenced by population structure, with a high proportion of elderly, children, or individuals with limited mobility increasing challenges in evacuation, medical care, and overall disaster resilience.

**Proximity to Hazard:**

- The closer a population is to a hazard, the higher the vulnerability, as immediate exposure increases the risk of direct impact, reducing preparation time and exacerbating the potential for casualties and damage.

**Poverty:**

- Poverty enhances vulnerability by limiting access to resources, hindering infrastructure development, and reducing the ability of communities to prepare, respond, and recover from disasters.

**Political Stability:**

- Political instability increases vulnerability as it can hinder effective governance, coordination of emergency response, and the allocation of resources needed to mitigate the impact of disasters.

**Level of Infrastructure Development:**

- Insufficient infrastructure development raises vulnerability by limiting the capacity to withstand and recover from disasters, impairing transportation, communication, and emergency services.

**Education:**

- Low levels of education contribute to vulnerability by impeding community awareness, preparedness, and the ability to understand and respond to warnings and instructions during a disaster.
