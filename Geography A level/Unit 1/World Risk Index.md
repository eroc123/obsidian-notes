- Looks at two factors
	- How much exposure to natural disasters does a country have (such as tsunami's, cyclones)
	- How much capacity to cope (deal with) with natural disasters the country has
- e.g. Vanuatu has high risk index due to high exposure and low capacity, whilst Japan has lower risk even with high exposure due to high capacity to cope
