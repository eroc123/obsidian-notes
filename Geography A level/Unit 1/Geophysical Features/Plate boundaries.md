#### Divergent (constructive)

Where two plates are pulled apart from each other - magma can rise and form new crust
#### Convergent (destructive)

Where two plates collide with each other - if the plates are of equal density, they fold and force each other up to form mountain ranges whilst if its one oceanic and one continental plate, the denser oceanic plate sinks beneath the less dense continental plate
 
#### Transform (conservative)

Where two plates slide past each other
