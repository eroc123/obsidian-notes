![[earth layers]]

#### Oceanic vs Continental crust
**Oceanic:**
- Denser
- Made of basalt
- Thinner (10 km or less)
**Continental**
- Less dense
- Made of granite 
- Thicker 25-70 km


#### Lithosphere vs Asthenosphere
**Lithosphere:**
- Includes the upper most part of the mantle and the crust and is 100 km thick
- Solid rock
- Is broken up into plate tectonics 
- Categorized as oceanic and continental
**Asthenosphere:**
- Is the layer directly below the lithosphere and includes the upper part of the mantle
- Extends from 100km to 700 km deep
- It is hotter and more fluid than the lithosphere and has plastic properties - allows for a few inches of movement per year
- Where convection currents arise
