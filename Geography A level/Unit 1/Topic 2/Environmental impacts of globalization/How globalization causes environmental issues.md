##### Land use changes
- Deforestation:
	- Caused by urbanization
	- Caused by increased agricultural use
	- Need for resources like timber for paper, or for the creation of palm oil farms (look at southern Thailand or Indonesia)
	- Releases CO2
	- Caused by need for transport, e.g. constructing roads or tunnels
	- Destroys natural habitats
	- 22% of world's mammals threatened with extinction
- Land exploitation
	- for agriculture

##### Transport
- Release of CO2 from transport, e.g. shipping or aviation (4.9% of global emissions from airplanes)
- Globalization has caused increased transport and shipping transport, in addition to transport of goods longer distances due to global trade

##### Energy
- increased energy consumption requires more electricity production, which mainly comes from fossil fuels
	- China opens one new coal-fired power plant every week
##### Pollution
- Toxic waste, e.g. from industry degrades land and is released into soil - especially bad in developing countries where environmental regulations are lax/not enforced 
- Increased plastic usage due to increased use of consumer goods causes increased land and water pollution - non-biodegradable product
	- used for packaging
	- used as it is cheap
- fertilizer and pesticide runoff contaminates water
