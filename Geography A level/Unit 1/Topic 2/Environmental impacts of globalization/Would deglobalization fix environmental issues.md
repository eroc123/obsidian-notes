##### Technology diffusion
- environmental technologies would no longer spread from countries with strict environmental standards - leading to more pollution


##### Production
- each country trying to meet their own domestic demand would lead to increased production worldwide (due to lower efficiency, less specialization, etc.)
- e.g. Iran - domestic firms must provide enough resources for country, which has led to immense environmental damage as Iran does not contribute to world economy
- Without globalization, consumers will not be aware about environmental and labour standards of many products, hence there will be less consideration about environment

##### Trade and policy incentives
- In China, incentives for its products has led China to tackle its environmental issues
- Isolating countries may make them think they are no longer responsible for the environment
- WTO increased enthusiasm for environmentally friendly trade policies - incentive for countries to become more environmentally friendly
