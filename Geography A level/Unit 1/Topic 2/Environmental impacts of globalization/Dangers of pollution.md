##### Water pollution
- results in deaths from gastrointestinal diseases and parasitic infections
- e.g. cholera, typhoid

##### Air pollution
- increases risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, e.g. stroke, lung cancer, heart attacks - 5 million die prematurely a year due to air pollution

##### Vulnerability 
- in developing countries, people cannot protect themselves as they cannot afford protections against pollution, e.g. air purifiers
- very expensive on developed countries to manage
