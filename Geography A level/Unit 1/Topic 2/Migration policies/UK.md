##### Geographical
- island, no land crossing, only air and ship through airports and ports which are highly managed
- have one land crossing through the chunnel - heavily controlled

##### Policy
- Point based system - 70 points needed 
- Need skills, e.g. english proficiency, job offer, PhD which each provides points
- If there is a worker shortage, extra points granted 
- No longer in the EU after brexit, migrants from EU countries no longer have free movement into the UK - requires visas which makes UK a less attractive destination
