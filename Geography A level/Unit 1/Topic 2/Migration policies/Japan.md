##### Geography
- Is an island, easier to manage as there is no land connection, same reason as [[UK]]

##### Policy
- Against migration generally both within politics and within society
- Stance has been changing, Japan now has a quota via its specified special worker program of 800,000 migrants per year and foreign population has increased by 12.4% compared to 2023.
- Has not adopted a formal immigration policy yet.

##### Culture
- Homogenous, people weary towards foreigners 
- Cultural roots - fear that foreigners will disrupt harmony of Japanese society - perception that foreigners will cause increased crime
