Intro: Migration is the net movement of people from one area to another, either within a country or internationally. Due to varying levels of migration in different regions of the world and regional factors such as geography, culture and the existance of trade blocs, different places may have a much easier time managing migration compared to others.


Structure:


**Paragraph 1** How countries can manage it successfully

e.g. UK point based system, US visa quotas of 700,000 and expand

**Paragraph 2** What may limit countries from manage migration successfully

e.g. EU and Germany - 1.1 million Syrian migrants in 2015 due to relative free movement of people across EU - very porous borders makes it easy for migrants to move 
- causes issues for Germany

**Paragraph 3** External factors which allow migration to be managed more easily in some countries than others

e.g. Japan and UK - geographic isolation, being an island makes it more difficult to migrants to come illegally as ports and aiports are well controlled 

Even though migration can be managed effectively to an extent by strict quotas and regulations, external factors may ultimately become a larger factor due to the increasing frequency of crisis events, especially conflict and climate related crisis events. Increased emigration from these places may place greater strain on host countries, especially those bordering crisis regions and render strict migration policies less effective as illegal immigration increases.
