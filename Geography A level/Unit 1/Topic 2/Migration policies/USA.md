##### Geographical
- large land borders with neighbors, e.g. Mexico which is a large source of migrants
	- even with large fences, border guards and cameras it is still a very permeable border

##### Policy
-  Politically divided on immigration issue, especially with Donald Trump's administration 
	- Democrats are generally pro-immigration, republicans generally anti-immigration - very polarized
	- Donald trump wanted to build a wall
- cap of 700,000 migrants per year, no more than 7% of that cap can be met by migrants from one country.
- migrants make up 14.4% of US population, Mexican migrants make up a quarter of migrant population.
