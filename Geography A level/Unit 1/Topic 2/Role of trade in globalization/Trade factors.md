| <br>Locational<br>advantage | The amount of natural resources a country plays a large role in the extent<br>to which is it able to trade. This was particularly the case historically;<br>indeed, the wealth of countries such as Canada and Australia were built<br>largely on the export of raw materials.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| <br>Historical<br>factors   | Trading patterns are often based on colonial ties. E.g. the UK still<br>maintains significant trading links with Commonwealth countries based<br>on ties which were established during colonial times. However, these<br>relationships were often uneven, putting the colonies in a subordinate<br>position which brought them few benefits. Some argue that this is why to<br>this day poorer tropical countries have such a limited share of world<br>trade.                    |
| Resource<br>endowment       | Based on what a country is naturally endowed with, they will tend to<br>specialize in a particular area. Countries then export what they are<br>naturally endowed with but import other goods. This applies not just to<br>raw materials, but also extends to manufactured goods and also services.<br>We see this exemplified in the fact that some countries have a reputation<br>for particular products, e.g. German cars, Japanese high-tech products,<br>Swiss watches.<br> |
| Comparative<br>advantage    | Proximity to markets is advantageous for trade, in particular as it reduces<br>transport costs. E.g. Canadian manufacturing benefits from proximity to a<br>large American market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Investment                  | When a country is invested in trade often increases. This is referred to<br>as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). This helps low income countries<br>become viable traders in the global market. However, the level of<br>investment is often linked to how stable a country is as FDI is unlikely to<br>take place in locations where crime and corruption are widespread.                                                                                                         |
