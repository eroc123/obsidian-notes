##### Background
- Steel industry in Pittsburg (city in Northeast US) grew due to railway construction boom in 1860, combined with engineering industries constructing more locomotives, steam ships, civil infrastructure, etc.
- Shifted from small-scale manufacturing to large-scale mass production along rivers and railways for infrastructure
##### Decline
- In 1970-80, steel manufacturing in Pittsburgh declined due to:
	- competition from foreign steel producers in South Korea and Japan which produced steel for cheaper - due to lower wages and weaker unions
	- outdated tech in factories - newest producers had latest tech, allowing for cheap steel production
	- 25% of factories in Pittsburgh in 1980 were using outdated methods to produce steel


##### Effects
- 130,000 manufacturing jobs lost between 1979 and 1987
- Population fell from 1.3 million in 1950 to 714,000 in 2011
- Shops declined as customers moved away or could no longer afford products
	- e.g. car show rooms closed
- House prices fell - there was a house online for sale for 1 USD in Pittsburgh
