- Steel production has shifted from Europe/N. America to Asia

##### Reasons:
- Better technology
	- mining of ores, transporting ores in bulk, smelting
- Oversupply
	- supply of steel by companies in Brazil, South Korea undercut the price of steel (due to lower labour costs) produced by EU, US. Use of tariff barriers deemed unlawful by WTO
- Consolidation among companies
	- Smaller, less efficient steel plants outcompeted by larger companies which had merged to take advantage of economies of scale
	- e.g. Chinese demand led to price increases benefitting large companies the most (China produces 25% of world's steel demand)
- Stricter environmental legislation in Europe
	- e.g. the cost of complying with emissions regulations such as carbon monoxide
- Offshoring
	- setting up steel plants near major markets to reduce transport costs
