- Some areas have not been affected by globalization mainly due to:
	- **Political instability** - wars, conflicts, corruption deter investors due to risk
	- **Debt** - reduces economic growth and prevents investment into human resources
	- **Lack of infrastructure** - production costs are higher and distribution is unreliable due to bad water supply, bad electricity supply, bad roads, e.g.
	- **Phyiscal constraints** - hard to get to/remote
	- **Poverty and disease** - produce low-skilled workforce which is difficult to train
- mainly found in parts of south Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa
