##### Background
- 80% of Tanzania working population employed in agriculture - has fertile volcanic soil
- Most of the population farms cotton 

##### Reasons for connectivity/disconnectivity
- **Cotton price fluctuations**
	- When cotton prices rose, farmers farmed more cotton
	- However, overproduction caused price to fall
	- Due to price fluctuations, GDP also fluctuates and means that Tanzania struggles to globalize due to lack of guaranteed income
		- also reduces foreign trade (esp imports)
- **Growing investment links**
	- Growing links with India, China, Japan, UAE to export its farm produce and mineral resources - [[Trade factors|increases trade and hence globalizaiton]]
- **Debt cancellation**
	- Tanzania had serious debt problems - was a Heavily Indebted Poor Countries until 2001 (HIPC)
	- When the debt was cancelled/rescheduled, Tanzania was better able to reinvest in schools and healthcare, hence improving connectivity and development indicators
