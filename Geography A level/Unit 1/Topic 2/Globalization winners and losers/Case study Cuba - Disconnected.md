##### Background
- Cuba is one of the only countries that is a one party Marxist-Leninist socialist state - under a communist ideological system 
- Became communist after Cuban revolution in the 1950's

##### Effect of Socialism on Cuba
- Was aligned with the USSR during the cold war and traded with other socialist states 
	- Due to this, Cuba was cut off from trading with the US and its allies - part of the US trade embargo 
	- **It was a divided world - capitalist and communist bloc**
	- Worsened by Cuban missile crisis
	- After the collapse of USSR and the subsequent collapse of communism, Cuba became isolated - still being embargoed by US
- Low disposable GDP due to majority being spent on social welfare - spend on themselves
- Hostile foreign policy to many Western countries (promote socialist movements) - harms relations

##### Physical Geography Influences
###### Negative
- Located near a destructive plate boundary and within the Caribbean Hurricane Belt
- Prone to landslides due to high levels of annual rainfall and occurrence of limestone
- **Key point - multi-hazard location**
###### Positive
- Strategically located for industrialization - lies at the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico and has a long coastline
	- also near major markets such as the US
- Tropical climate and fertile volcanic soil gives high-quality agricultural land and diverse ecosystems (mangroves, beaches, coral reefs)
	- untouched ecosystems help promote tourism
- [[Tourism in Globalization|Limestone erosion has created stunning landscapes]]
    
##### Effects of Cuba's Isolation
- Unable to import upated technology and invest in transport, infrastructure and housing
	- Houses and business properties poorly maintained
	- Cars are from the 1950's before the trade embargo was in place
	- Limited access to mobile technology
	- Lack of maintenance and aging architecture has ironically created a unique style leading to Havana and Trinidad become World Heritage Sites
- Food shortages caused by decline in trade from collapse of USSR
- Restrictions on tourism 
	- This may have been a good thing, since ecosystems have been well preserved

##### Impacts of being more connected
- increased tourism - may cause issues due its impact [[Threat to Coastal Ecosystems|especially on ecosystems]]
- Increased demand for western products , especially among youth
- Facilitated by implementation of WiFi hotspots and mobile technology in cities like Havana -  tech from former Cuban allies
