- suggests that migration is caused by push (factors causing migrants to leave from an area) and pull factors (factors drawing migrants to an area)
- suggests existence of intervening obstacles which may hinder migrant's movement
##### Origin
- Where people migrate from
- Has some push factors, some pull factors
##### Transit
- has intervening obstacles, e.g. travelling from Africa to Europe illegally may have dangers especially when crossing the Mediterranean
- can also be more mundane obstacles, like flights being too expensive
- basically, intervening obstacles is anything that makes it difficult/hinders migrants from reaching destination from origin

##### Destination
- where people migrate to
- Has some push factors, some pull factors
- **when the overall effect of a destination's pull factors and the origin's push factors outweigh the origin's pull factors and a destination's push factors, migrants will make a decision to migrate. Only in the case that they can overcome intervening obstacles**
