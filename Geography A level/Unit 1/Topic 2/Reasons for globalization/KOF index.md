- Measures degree of globalization (0-100)
- Takes into account:
	- **Economic** - flow of trade, foreign direct investment, any restrictions to these flows
		- e.g. trade liberalization increases this
	- **Political** - characterized by degree of cooperation with other countries - measured by amount of embassies, international organization membership
	- **Social** - spread of ideas, information, tourism, cultural proximity (brands such as mcdonalds) 
		- also measured by personal contacts 
		- is generally American cultural products


##### Trends
- General progressive upwards trend (esp after cold war)
- generally poorer regions are less globalized
- smaller countries more globalized
	- smaller domestic markets, more limited natural resources makes it more lucrative for small countries, e.g. Singapore to globalize
	- larger countries have their own domestic market, economy and natural resources, making them less likely to globalize to the same extent
- countries with higher internet bandwidth are more globalized
- less globalized countries usually have faster-growing cities
