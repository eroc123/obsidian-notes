##### Communications
- Lack of technology - LEDC's may have reduced access to communication tools such as the internet 
	- Lower internet penetration rates (percentage of population with internet)
	- 16.7% of population in Ethiopia compared to 90.2% in Japan
	- Lower broadband speeds - 8.70 Mbps in Ethiopia vs 296.29 Mbps in Japan (download)
- Lack of wealth
	- Many people cannot access communication tools such as the internet, landline phones or computers
- Lack of knowledge
	- People in LEDC's are less educated on internet  or digital usage, making them less likely to use it
- Lack of electricity
	- No electricity in rural areas means no internet
##### Transport and economy
- Less transport connection 
	- LEDC's may have smaller economies, hence less trade and less economic globalization
	- Also less penetration by TNC's and other brand name companies
- Protectionist policies - trade tarrifs and barriers reduce trade
##### Political motives
- Restriction of free movement or free speech can reduce globalization levels
- e.g. in China there is a lot of internet censorship, reducing internet access to the wider world
	- Great Firewall of China, block access to applications such as Google and Facebook
