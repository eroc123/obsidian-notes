#### Beijing
**Causes:**
- Rapid industrialization 
- Coal-burning power stations and a vehicle boom caused increase in air pollution emissions.
- Topographical and seasonal conditions 
	- surrounded by mountains - traps pollution
	- spring and summer winds blow smog from industrialized south northwards to Beijing
**Solutions:**
- Implementing ultra low emission standards - forcing old vehicles off the road
- SEPA (State Environmental Protection Administration) implemented to reform environmental laws
- Implementing public transit (encourage people to use clean transit instead of driving)
- Implementing advanced air quality monitoring systems
- Shifting from coal to natural gas (natural gas is cleaner)-
