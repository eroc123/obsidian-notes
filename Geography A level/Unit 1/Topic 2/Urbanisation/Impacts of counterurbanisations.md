##### Reasons for urban-rural migration
- increased air pollution in London from congestion - cleaner and quieter to live in rural areas
- Rise of IT jobs and remote working - work can be done without having to commute to London
- Better transport from villages surrounding London - people can commute easily into central London from outside now


##### Consequences on London
- traffic congestion increases - more people commuting in from outside city areas
- affluent moves out of central areas - poor and their social problems left behind in inner city areas (more dereliction, more crime)

##### Consequences on receiving villages (SE London)
- house prices in villages pushed up - migrants sell expensive city properties and earn higher wages and can hence afford homes
- congestion increases as more people commute - especially bad on small country roads
- businesses and services adapt increasingly to the needs of the urban migrants - reduces village like environment, e.g. pub becomes restaurant
	- businesses that don't adapt like corner stores close - supermarkets and other urban services take over instead.
