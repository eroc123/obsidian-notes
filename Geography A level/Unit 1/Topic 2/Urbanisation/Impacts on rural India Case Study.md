- Location: Gandhingar, Gurjarat State
- City of Ahmedabad is growing into rural areas, displacing villages and covering farmland as neighborhoods, schools and roads are built.


##### Why this is happening
- Government has declared incentive to industrialize and stated that agriculture does not produce enough lucrative employment
- State government wants Ahmedabad and 12 other cities to grow and absorb 800 villages in the area
	- hence villagers have been protesting against state governments to get their villages removed from Jungadh Urban Development Authority 

##### Negative effects
- **Villagers are often low skilled and can only work in agriculture - not suited for urban environment which requires higher skills**
	- may cause them to have to work as daily wage workers - long hours for low pay and keep them in poverty
- **Lower agricultural yields - forced to work with smaller plots** 
	- farmers farm crops such as groundnuts, cotton, wheat
- **Lower groundwater supply**
	- more concrete pavement, rainfall can no longer infiltrate into soil above urban areas
	- groundwater and other water sources, e.g. rivers get increasingly consumed by growing cities, leaving less for irrigation
	- government is going to shut off irrigiation due to increased water demand by cities to farmers from March of every year, even though monsoon rains do not come until June - farmers are much more reliant on groundwater wells 
	- especially relavent in INdia, which has long dry seasons and short, intense monsoon seasons
- **agricultural land displaced and built over**
- **gov says people are migrating to cities for better life but Dara Singh from Namsed vilalge disagrees**
	- The village is part of an urban development project Auda but has not seen improvements to their infrastructure
