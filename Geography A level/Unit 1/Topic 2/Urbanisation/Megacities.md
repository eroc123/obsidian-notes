##### How and why the number of megacities have changed over time

- 2 megacities in 1950, Tokyo and Osaka
- 37 megacities in 2017, over half of them in Asia (in countries like India and China) 
- before megacities only found in HIC's in Europe and N. America, now they are found on every continent except Oceania and Antarctica

- Have increased rapidly due to several factors:
	- Rapid economic growth in emerging economies like India have drawn people from agricultural jobs in rural areas to manufacturing jobs in urban areas
	- Globalization, establishment of TNC headquarters in HIC's have drawn people to cities in HIC's for research, development and decision making
	- Globalization, outsourcing of [[Outsourcing costs and benefits|manufacturing by TNCs]] leads to formation of large urban areas in LEDCs and large urban areas in MEDCs as global core regions (where TNCs are headquartered and financial decisions are made)
	- Establishment of [[Special Economic Zones|SEZ's]] and port cities - encourage trade, FDI and manufacturing such as in cities like Shenzen - draws migrants to these areas and creates huge urban conglomerates

##### Distribution of megacities change
- **Economic**
	- rapid economic growth in India and China coupled with rapid growth of manufacturing has led to increase in number of megacities in Asia (more migrants drawn to megacities)
	- increased trade due to globalization leads to development of large port cities like Shenzen
	- rise of TNC's lead to growth of megacities in Europe and North America (although to a much lesser extent than in Asia)
- **Social**
	- rapid population growth and rural urban migration from economic growth leads to rapid growth of megacities in developing regions like Asia and Africa
