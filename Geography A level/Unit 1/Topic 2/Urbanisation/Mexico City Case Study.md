##### Background
- is in a high-altitude, bowl shaped valley
- built over a lake which was naturally fed by mountain springs and streams
##### Problem
- l**ack of freshwater resources**
	- was not managed properly ever since Spanish colonization 400 years ago
	- still isn't managed properly today
	- lake Texcoco that Mexico City was built on has been dried up and built over
	- rainwater from rainy season not enough to refill
- **large water leakage in pipes**
	- 11 cubic meters water lost per second from leaks
	- low water pressure in some areas causes contamination from soil into water supplies
	- even worse since soil is contaminated by leaky sewage

##### Hot it was managed/not being managed
- Aquifers underneath Mexico City drained faster than they can be replenished - causes [[Sea level rise causes|ground subsidence]]
- Expensive water transfer being done 
	- Cutzamala transfer system - 485 million cubic meters a year
	- very problematic - high energy usage as water is pumped up 1000 meters and over 150 kilometers
- water leakage project to prevent water leaks
	- adding hydraulic and pressure control valves to reduce water losses (35% down to 23% of flow rate lost)
