##### Smart electrial grids
- allow for energy savings, manage energy more effectively

##### Precision agriculture techniques
- improving crop yields, assisting management decisions using high technology sensor and analysis tools - data about farms collected in real time using sensors

##### Renewable energy technology
- higher efficiency, lower cost, improved energy storage capabilities will help make renewable energy even more feasable in future


##### Water Purification and Desalination
- advanced water purification and desalination technologies can provide clean drinking water from abundant but unusable saline sources like seawater, good for arid regions - even better if water purification becomes cheap and allows poor regions to use it too.
