- theory is population will grow more rapidly than our ability to grow food/our ability to provide enough resources, causing us to starve
- food production increases arithmetically, population grows geometrically
- **theory mostly wrong for now** - advances in agriculture, e.g. better seeds, mechanized agriculture, fertilizer have allowed for global population to mainly avoid starvation
- another issue is our per capita resource consumption - now global population growth isn't only threat towards resources, our consumption patterns are too now
- Human Impact = Population x Affluence x Technology
