##### UN projections

- Population expected to peak in 2100
###### High Projection
- assumption that fertility rate will be 0.5 higher than the medium variant - estimated to be around 15 billion by 2100 (constant population growth, constant rate)

###### Medium Projection
- most likely projection - most other projections based off this one - estimated to be around 10 billion by 2100 (constant population growth, rate slowdown)

###### Low Projection
- assumption that fertility rate will be 0.5 lower than the medium variant - population growth (slowing population growth to a peak in 2050 at around 9 billion, and then decline to 7 billion in 2100)

###### Constant Fertility Rate Scenario
- Not a realistic scenario, just a playout  to see how the world population would change if they remained constant - spikes to 25 billion
