##### Background
- Since 2011 and the Arab Spring, there has been a civil war in Syria including multiple parties, including ISIS, government forces, other rebel forces. Ongoing as of 2024
- Many people have hence fled the country or have been internally displaced (14 million out of 23 million)

##### Trends in migration
- Majority of migrants have been rehoused in refugee camps in neighboring countries, e.g. Turkiye, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt (5.5 million)
- Germany houses 850,000 Syrian migrants and is the largest non-neighboring host country 
	- Other EU countries such as Sweden also house large numbers of migrants - free movement of people in EU have made it easier for migrants to travel to third/fourth countries from their origin
- Economic challenges, lack of infrastructure, inflation especially in food prices from Ukraine-Russia war have made life much more difficult for Syrian migrants who already lack basic necessities such as food, water and shelter. 
	- especially in Lebanon
- Syria still **is too dangerous** for return - many migrants living in limbo in refugee camps
