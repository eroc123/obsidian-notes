 **Pollen Analysis**
- Historical pollen samples can be extracted from the bottom of ponds/lakes/oceans
- Unique shape can help scientists determine the types of plants that grew in that area
- Can make inferences about climate based on plant distribution
**Historical Sources**
- Early instrument records
- Government records
- Ancient inscriptions
- Chronicles
- Commercial records
- Data must be analyzed, especially subjective data via content analysis (how bad is "severe" for example) and cross referenced with modern instrument data.
	- Other info such as spacial extent must also be determined.
**Art**
- Studying features of art to get an idea of climatic conditions or links to possible events in the time.
	- Especially landscape art, for example orange red colors were common in the 1830's due to the eruption of Tambora spewing large quantities of volcanic ash into the atmosphere and scattering the sunlight.
