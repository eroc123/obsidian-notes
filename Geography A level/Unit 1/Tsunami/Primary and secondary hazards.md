**Primary hazards:** Impacts caused directly by the hazard - e.g. collapsing buildings from an earthquake or coastal flooding from tsunamis
**Secondary hazards:** Impacts not directly caused by the hazard, but as a result of another impact caused by the primary hazard. e.g. collapsed electrical poles caused by earthquakes causes a fire, or diseases caused by coastal flooding from tsunamis
