- Tsunami's are large waves that transfer energy but not mass and have a trough and a crest.
- They are formed by geological factors occurring under the water
	- Submarine landslides
	- Undersea earthquakes
	- Volcanic eruptions

**Normal waves vs tsunamis**
- Normal [[obsidian-notes/Geography A level/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Waves/Wave creation|wave's]] source of energy is from wind and friction on the surface of the water, creating waves
- Tsunami wave's (NOT TIDAL WAVE) source of energy is from undersea geophysical forces.
