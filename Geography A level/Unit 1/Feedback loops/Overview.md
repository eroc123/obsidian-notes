- series of events triggered by an initial change, where the triggered events can either amplify or dampen the initial change. 
- positive feedback loop occurs when the resulting events amplify the original trigger and hence amplify the resulting events
- negative feedback loop occurs when the resulting events dampen the original trigger and dampen the next set of events.
