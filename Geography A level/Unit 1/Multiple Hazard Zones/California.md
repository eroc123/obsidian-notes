- Population: 40 million
- Population Density: 96.6 km^2
- Types of hazards: 
	- **[[Earthquake causes|Earthquakes]]**
		- Situated on active fault lines such as the San Andreas Fault
		- Pacific Plate and the North American plate are both moving northwest, but the Pacific plate is moving faster, causing friction
	- Wildfires
	- Droughts
	- Tsunamis
	- Landslides
	- Floods 
		- [[ENSO]] increases amount of rainfall that California gets, increasing chance of landslides and coastal erosion
	- Coastal Erosion
- GDP
	- 3.6 trillion USD
	- 68,000 USD per capita
- Land use
	- Clear zoning laws - dictates how land or city or town in California can be used, categories include agriculture, residential, commercial and industrial
- Topography
	- Diverse. Mountain ranges, valleys, flat land, coast.
- Poverty rate
	- 13.2% lives below the poverty line
- Hazard frequency: 
	- 2-3 earthquakes large enough to cause damage per year
- Solutions to hazards
	- Aseismic design: buildings are less prone to collapse as they are designed to withstand earthquakes
	- Multi-Hazards Demonstration Project: initiated in 2007 by the US Geological Survey helps communities in southern California reduce death and destruction from natural hazards
