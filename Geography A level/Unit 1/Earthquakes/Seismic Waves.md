| Body waves (waves travelling within the earth)     | Primary (P) waves   | Are longitudinal waves - Can travel through solids, liquids, gases - first to reach seismic recording stations                                            |
|                                                    | Secondary (S) waves | Are transverse waves - ground oscillates perpendicular to direction of motion - arrives after P waves and only travel thorugh solids                      |
| Surface waves (travel across surface of the earth) | Love waves          | Are transverse waves and move the surface side to side. Arrives after S waves and is much more destructive than body waves. Can only move through solids. |
|                                                    | Rayleigh waves      | Are transverse waves and shake the ground in an elliptical pattern - spread out the most and arrive last - giving a long duration on seismographs.                                                                                                                                                          |
