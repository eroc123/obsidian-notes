1. Water evaporated from ocean surface (with water temperature 26 degrees or above)
2. Humid air rises
3. Humid air condenses and forms thunderclouds
4. Rotation of Earth causes system to spin - rising air builds a storm system
5. Hurricane forms when sustained wind speed (1 min) exceeds 119 km/h
	- Cloudless eye of storm formed - dense air sinks down the middle
