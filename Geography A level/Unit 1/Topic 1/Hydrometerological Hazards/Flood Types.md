**Tidal**
- Caused by the sea and tidal rivers and extreme high tidal events (above normal high-tide mark)
**Groundwater Flooding**
- Occurs when water rises up from underlying rocks or from abnormal springs
**Pluvial Flooding**
- When the soil is saturated with water, excess water pools up and cannot drain. Occurs when there is intense rain in a short period of time which cannot drain in time.
**Coastal Flooding**
- Caused also by the sea when saltwater inundates (submerges) low-lying coastal areas. Can be caused by storm surges, tsunamis or strong waves from storms.

- Is a short-term hazard
