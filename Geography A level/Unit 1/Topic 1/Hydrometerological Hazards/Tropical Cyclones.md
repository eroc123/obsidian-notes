- Large, rotating storms with high wind speeds
- Are [[Short term vs Medium term hazards|short term hazards]]

#### Formation
1. Warm sea surface temperatures (>27 degrees ) cause large volumes of water to evaporate and moist air to rise
2. Moist air condenses into clouds high in the atmosphere and forms storms (cumulonimbus clouds)
3. The Earth's roration causes the storm clouds to start spinning anticlockwise
4. As winds pick up, the storm becomes [[categorized]] as a hurricane once winds exceed 119 km/h via the Saffir Simpson Scale

#### Distribution
- Areas with warm sea temperatures (>27 degrees)
- Near the equator - tropical/subtropical region excluding the region between 5 degrees south and 5 degrees north (they don't form at the equator).
- General east-west track
- Occur in areas with a sea temperature higher than 27 degrees celsius except parts of eastern Australia and northern Japan
