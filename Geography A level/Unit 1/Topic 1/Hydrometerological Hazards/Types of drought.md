| Drought type   | Cause                                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Meterological  | Lower than normal precipiation                                     |
| Hydrological   | Caused by depletion of water reserves - rivers, lakes, groundwater |
| Agricultural   | Caused when soil water levels drop and crops begin to die          |
| Socio-economic | Caused by increasing demand for water as development increases     |
- Meterological droughts often lead to hydrological and agricultural droughts
- Hydrological droughts takes much longer to develop and recover from compared to  meterological
- Linked to [[ENSO|El Nino and La NIna]] phenomenan
