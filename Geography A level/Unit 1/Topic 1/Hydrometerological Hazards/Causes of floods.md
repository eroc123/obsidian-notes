| Cause | Explanation | Human or Physical |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Increased Urbanization | Paving of large areas combined with inadequate drainage infrastructure means that excess water cannot be absorbed as quickly, increasing surface run off and worsening pluvial flooding. Water runs off quickly and causes flash flooding. | Human |
| Large storms | Storms such as tropical cyclones can cause storm surges and coastal flooding, combined with their intense rainfall which can cause pluvial flooding or rivers to burst their banks. | Natural (although worsened by climate change which is human) |
| Deforestation | Vegetation helps to intercept rain in addition to slowing runoff, increasing the **lag time** between rainfall and flood and hence reducing the peak flood intensity. If the vegetation is cleared, runoff quickly ends up in rivers and creates a flood with a much higher peak intensity. | Is human |
| Moon phases | When high tides caused by the astronomical tide cycle overlap with strong waves or storm surges, coastal flooding risk is increased significantly, especially due to the already elevated sea level. When the sun and moon line up, there can also be king tides, which are exceptionally high tides | Is natural |
| Drought | Drought creates impermeable surface (sun bakes the ground), therefore when it does rain, there is a high risk for [[Flood Types\|pluvial flooding]] to occur, as water cannot be absorbed and thus runs off quickly. | Is natural (worsened by climate change) |
