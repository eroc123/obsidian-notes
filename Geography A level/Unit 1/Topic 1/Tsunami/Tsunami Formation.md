1. **Tectonic:** Large volumes of water is displaced via undersea forces such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions - lots of energy is released
2. **Build:** Released energy propagates as simple oscillating waves over the ocean surface at speeds of 800 kilometers per hour.
3. **Travel:** Wavelengths of the waves grow
4. **Approach:** Tsunami slows down dramatically as it reaches shallower coasts due to friction, the wavelength increases and the amplitude rapidly increases
5. **Impact:** Before the wave hits, the water retreats far from the shoreline - much farther than low tide. When the wave hits, it causes massive damage before pulling the water back to sea, causing further damage. (similar to how a normal wave operates but much larger)


**Tsunami Summary:**
- An underwater geophysical event (e.g. an earthquake) displaces a large volume of water, creating a series of high energy waves that are capable of causing coastal flooding and damage when it hits the coast.
