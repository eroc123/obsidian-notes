##### Background
- Melting arctic sea ice is reducing sea ice cover especially in summer
- Provides opportunity for increased shipping in the Arctic - following the northern Russian coastline or northern Canadian coastline
- Previously invested in by USSR, however due declined due lack of investment and sea ice variation afterwards

##### Economic Benefits
- Can reduce travel distances between Asia and Europe by 40%
	- hence reducing carbon emissions
	- lower fuel costs
	- shorter shipping times
- Money to be made off ice breaking services - **can also be disadvantageous**
- Possibly up to 5% of world's trade can pass through here

##### Drawbacks
- Environmental consequences
	- Loud vessels affect marine behavior
	- Emits black carbon, decreasing albedo and worsening [[Geography A level/Unit 1/Topic 1/Climate Change Scenarios/Ice albedo feedback|ice albedo feedback loop]]
	- Cuts through spring migration passages used by birds and mammals - result in feeding periods being disrupted
- Economic consequences
	- Ships can get stuck in variable sea ice
	- Lack of infrastructure currently, need more expansion of deep-water ports, shippings
	- reliance on ice breaking companies 
	- more fuel consumption to work through broken ice
