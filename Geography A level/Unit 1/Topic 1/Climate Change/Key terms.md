**Global warming** - The rise in global temperatures due mainly to the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
**Climate change** - Increasing changes in the measures of climate over a long period of time, including precipitation, temperature and wind patterns
**Anthropogenic** - originating from human activity
**IPCC** - [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]
**Adaptation** - A process of change whereby something becomes more suited to new conditions
**Mitigation** - the action of reducing the severity or seriousness of something
**Carbon footprint** - The amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organization in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product
**Carbon neutral** - A process where there is no net release CO2. e.g. growing biomass takes CO2 out the atmosphere whilst burning it releases the gas again
The process would be carbon neutral if the amount taken and the amount released were identical/
**Emissions** - Any release of gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming - a major cause of climate change
**Feedback loop** - Rising temperatures on the Earth change the environment in ways that affect the rate of warming.
- Positive means adding to the rate of warming
- Negative means reducing
As arctic sea ice melts, the surface changes from being a bright reflective white to a darker blue or green which absorbs more of the Sun's rays and increases heating.
**Geo-engineering**;;Any technology that could be used to halt or reverse climate change. e.g. carbon dioxide extraction, deflecting the suns rays with mirrors

**Runaway climate change**;; Describes how climate change may suddenly get worse after passing a tipping point, making it even harder to stop or reverse.
**Greenhouse effect**;; Trapping of the sun's warmth in the Earth's lower atmosphere as infrared radiation emitted from the Earth's surface gets absorbed by greenhouse gases.
**Greenhouse gases**;; gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and can absorb infrared radiation emitted from the Earth's surface e.g. carbon dioxide.

**Tipping point**;;a critical threshold that, when crossed, leads to large, accelerating and often irreversible changes in the climate system
