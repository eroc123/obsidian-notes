- Limiting global warming to 2 degrees and increasing efforts to limit to 1.5
	- Even if we overshoot 1.5 degrees, the trend can be reversed by the end of the century if countries reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically.
- World must reach net 0 by 2050 to limit climate change
	- e.g. by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, forestry, construction, and other land use.
	- e.g. carbon removal tech usage.
- **Cost of change is lower than cost of inaction** and **many mitigation options have multiple benefits** e.g. improved air quality, increased energy security, increased health and quality of life.
	- Requires an increase in investment to make required changes, however investment overall will only amount to a few gdp percentage points.
- Requires transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure such as transport and buildings. Also requires changes in behavior, such as dietary changes and reduce meat eating.
