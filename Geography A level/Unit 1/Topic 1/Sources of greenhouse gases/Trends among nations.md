##### Sources of greenhouse gas emissions
- Electricity and heat
- Agriculture and land use
- Industry
- Transportation
- Food waste
- buildings
- other energy

##### Global Trend
- Rising emissions (most years)
	- caused mainly by industrial processes and fossil fuel combustions
	- also caused by land use changes such as deforestation and agriculture
- Stagnant emissions (2016)
	- Reduction in coal usage since 2011, mainly in China and USA
- Emissions increasing again past 2016
	- Increased number of cars on roads and increase in coal usage again


##### Different levels of development among nations
###### Developed countries
- Have high emissions per capita (e.g. Australia has 15.4 tonnes per capita in 1960, grown sharply from 8.6 in 1960)

###### Emerging countries
- Have low emissions per capita (though rapidly rising) - e.g. China is at 7.7 tonnes in 2014, up from 1.2 in 1960

###### Developing countries
- Have very low emissions per capita, e.g. Ethiopia - 0.1 tonnes in 2014
