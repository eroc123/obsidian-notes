##### Ocean Carbon Sink
![[Pasted image 20240303135246.png]]
**CO2 heating**
-  Water warms - holds less CO2
-  Increase CO2, increase warmth
-  More warmth means water warms, holds even less CO2

**Thermohaline Circulation Disruption**
- Water warms, thermohaline circulation disrupted, possibly by warming water which means its more difficult for water to sink and continue the circulation
- Thermohaline circulation helps bury carbon in the deep ocean - disruption means it cannot do this as well
- Less CO2 buried, more CO2 ends up in atmosphere
- More CO2 -> more warming -> more thermohaline disruption

**Marine ecosystem disruption**
- More CO2 absorbed -> ocean pH goes down
- Acidic water harms organisms which use Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) shells by dissolving them
##### Ice Albedo Feedback
![[Pasted image 20240303135301.png]]
- Atmosphere warms, sea ice melts
- Sea ice melts, less reflective, high albedo surface is covering the ocean
- More sunlight is absorbed by low albedo, dark ocean surface
- Ocean warms -> warms atmosphere too
- More sea ice melts
##### Forest Die-Back
![[Pasted image 20240303135321.png]]

- Atmosphere warms -> less rainfall
- Causes increased risk of drought
- Shrubs and trees become dry and die
- Wildfires more likely
- Forest is lost -> soil degrades -> causing more forest loss
- [[vegetation |Reduces rainfall]] ->
