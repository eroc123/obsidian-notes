##### Methane
- Methane coneentration rose overall due to anthropogenic activity
- Stagnated shortly around the year 2000 until around 2007
- Increased again after 2007
- Sink of methane is soil, oxidation


##### Carbon Dioxide
- Cycles of 100,000 years where ppm rises gradually then falls rapidly
- varied between 200-280 ppm
- In phase with temperature and out of phase with ice coverage
- Rose to 418ppm over past 150 years due to anthropogenic activity


##### Humidity
- Humidity increases 1.49% per decade
- Varies with temperature change - warmer temperatures means more evaporation- also warm air can carry more water
- Overall increasing - measured as a column from surface to top of atmosphere  



- 44% of human emissions are absorbed by terrestrial processes
- 29% by ecosystems
- 23% by oceans
- 4% unnacounted
