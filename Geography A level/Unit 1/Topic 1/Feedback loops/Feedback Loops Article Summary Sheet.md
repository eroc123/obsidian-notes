- **Feedback loops** are a series of events triggered by an initial change, where the triggered events can either amplify or dampen the initial change. 
- **positive feedback loop** occurs when the resulting events amplify the original trigger and hence amplify the resulting events - "accelerates"
	- can quickly go out of control if not restricted.
- **negative feedback loop** occurs when the resulting events dampen the original trigger and dampen the next set of events - "decelerates" and "self-stabilizes"
- **tipping points** - small changes within the climate system that can change a fairly stable system to a very different state.


### Arctic feedback loops

##### Thawing of Permafrost 
- Permafrost holds large volumes of carbon and methane
	- Methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas that is 120 times more powerful than CO2 at trapping heat (although it is short lived and only 20% remains in the atmosphere after 20 years)
- Frozen peat bogs also hold methane and carbon
- As the permafrost and peat bogs thaw, they release methane and carbon into the atmosphere. 
- The increased concentration of methane and carbon increases warming, hence accelerating melting

##### Thawing of Sea Ice
- Sea ice creates a large, white surface with a high albedo (50-70% of sunlight reflected)
- As the Earth warms, sea ice extent shrinks, especially in summer.
- More of the ocean's darker surface is hence exposed, absorbing more sunlight. 
	- Ocean reflects just 6% of incoming solar energy 
- The ocean warms the surrounding atmosphere, which then accelerates ice melting.
