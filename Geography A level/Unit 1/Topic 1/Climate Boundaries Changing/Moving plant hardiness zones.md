##### Plant hardiness
- Ranges from 1-11 
	- 1 is coldest zone
	- 11 is warmest zone
- Hardiness measured based on average annual minimum temperature - determines which plants can survive over the winter. 
- Divided into 10 degrees fahrenheit bands, e.g. -60 to -50 F is zone 1.

##### Change in hardiness zone cause
- Hardiness zone has been moving northwards  
	- e.g. somewhere which used to be hardiness zone 5 might be 6 now.
	- 13.3 miles per decade
- May be due to more detailed mapping techniques
- May also be due to climate change and warming temps.
