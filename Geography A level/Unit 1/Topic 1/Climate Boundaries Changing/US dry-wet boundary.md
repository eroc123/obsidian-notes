##### Background
- US has a lush, humid eastern region and drier western plains.
- Climatic transition zone was originally roughly on 100th meridian west.
- Wheat is grown west of the boundary (drier) and corn is grown east of the boundary (wetter)

##### What has happened
- Little change in rainfall in the northern plains
- reduced rainfall in the south due to wind pattern changes
- Higher temps cause increased evaporation and hence drier soils
- Transition line between wet and dry has moved east by 140 miles since 1980
