- [[Sahel background|unreliable]] rainfall makes region vulnerable to drought (and floods)
	- monthly rainfall varies from year to year
	- high spatial variability in rainfall too
		- e.g. within 10km, there can be huge changes in rainfall (one area has lots rainfall, another has none)
		- within 20-30 km there are variations in annual rainfall
-  demographic changes (4% annual population growth)
	- strains resources, e.g. land, water
	- can cause conflict for resources, especially between livestock herders north of 400mm rainfall line and croppers south of it
		- they compete for resources when there is drought, e.g. foraging resources 
- hot climate - can lead to more heat stress
