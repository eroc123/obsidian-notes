##### General
- increase of 1.5-4 degrees
	- higher chance of heat stress and heatwaves
	- increase chance of drought and floods
	- generally hard to predict as monsoon is very variable in Sahel
- increase variability in rainfall 
	- can cause increasingly long wet/dry periods

##### Farming systems
- increased likelyhood and severity of drought may cause food insecurity and damage to farming systems productivity
	- stocks such as food grain, animal feed, animal health run short
- change in sowing and harvesting dates
- change in crop species
- less rangeland compared to cropped area
	- may cause reduction in cattle especially north of the 400mm line in livestock grazing systems as grass availability decreases
	- herds move south to more humid areas to forage
	- longer distances and durations of movement
	- increased conflicts with people in crop-livestock systems for water and pasture resources
	- more camels in northern area
	- more movement in dry season due to decrease in avaliable rangeland and resources
