- Each magnitude on the scale is 10 times greater than the one before
- Measures moment of the earthquake (product of the distance a fault moved and the force required to move it)
- No upper limit

**Accuracy:**
- Energy release estimates same as richter scale up until magnitude 8- past that the Moment Magnitude scale is more accurate.

**Modelled**
- Earthquake is recorded at multiple stations and the earthquake is then modelled.
