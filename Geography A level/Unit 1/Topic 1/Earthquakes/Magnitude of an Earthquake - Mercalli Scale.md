- Measures damage caused by an earthquake via observations of the people who observed the quake

**Factors that affect damage caused:**
- Size of earthquake
- Distance from epicenter
- Depth of earthquake
- Building design (well designed buildings less likely to suffer damage and collapse)
- Type of material building rests on 
	- e.g. sand shakes more than rock
	- earthquakes on soft saturated soil may cause soil liquefaction and undermine building foundations.
