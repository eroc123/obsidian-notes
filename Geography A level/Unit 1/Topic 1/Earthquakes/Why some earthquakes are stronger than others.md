- The larger the fault, the higher the potential energy buildup before an earthquake
- Earthquakes at divergent plate boundaries are common and shallow, but usually low in magnitude
- Earthquakes at destructive plate boundaries are usually violent 
	- As the oceanic plate sinks beneath the continental plate, there is friction which builds up large amount of energy. When the energy is released, there is a large quake.
