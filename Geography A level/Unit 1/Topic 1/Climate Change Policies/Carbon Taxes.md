- Carbon tax is a policy for reducing/eliminating the use of fossil fuels - a way to get carbon fuel users to pay for the climate damage
- motivate switches to clean energy by making it more economically rewarding to move to non-carbon fuels and energy efficiency
- provides monetary motivation for consumers
- e.g. Canada's federal gov extended its carbon-pricing program nationwide by imposing a tax on fossil fuels in four provinces that had declined to write their own climate plans
