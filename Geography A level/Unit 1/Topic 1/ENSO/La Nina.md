- Below average sea surface temperatures in Eastern and Central tropical Pacific ocean
- Rainfall increases over Indonesia whilst rainfall decreases over eastern and central Pacific. Leads to cooler conditions in South Korea/Japan
- Caused when trade winds strengthen and cause an increased pooling of warm surface water in the eastern Pacific
- Cold water upwells (from underwater) and leads to increased cold water pooling in south America
- Leads to cool, dry conditions and increases the sea temperature difference betwen Australia and South America
