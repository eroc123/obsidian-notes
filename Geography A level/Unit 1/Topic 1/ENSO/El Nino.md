- Above average sea surface temperatures in central and eastern tropical Pacific ocean
- Causes drier conditions in Indonesia, whilst resulting in increased rainfall over the central and eastern Pacific

- Caused when trade winds (that blow east to west from South America to Australia) weaken or reverse
- Warm surface water which usually pools in Australia now gets spread across the entire Pacific and reduces the sea temperature difference between Aus and S. America
