| Drought                            | Standard Precipitation index/ Palmar drought severity Index | SPI shows actual precipitation vs probability of precipitation for various time scales. SPI of -1 or less indicates drought conditions. SPI is assigned for each month and when SPI exceeds 0, the drought ends. PDSI is similar to SPI but also takes into account temperature and soil moisture contents in calculating wet/dry figures.                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                        | SPI ranges from -2 (or less) to 2 (or higher) with higher values being wetter                                |
