**Physics**
- Location - If these are islands, tropical storms lose energy
- Weather conditions - hazrad can cause more flooding if rainfall has already happened
- Drainage basin - permeability of rock, size and relief of basin
**Human**
- Mitigation - engineering 
- Development
- Deforestation - less trees reduce [[Causes of floods|lag time]] between rain falling and reaching river.
