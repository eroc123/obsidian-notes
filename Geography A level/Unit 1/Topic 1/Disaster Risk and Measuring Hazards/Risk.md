Factors affecting risk: 
- Hazard unpredictability in timing and magnitude
- Lack of alternatives (people stay for work)
- Dynamic hazards - threats change over time and can be human influenced
- Cost- benefit calculations (is the cost of hazards worth the benefit of staying in an area)
- Russian-roulette reaction fatalism (just accept the fact that hazards occur here and nothing can be done about it)

Risk categories: social (death/injury/trauma), economic (goods/services/infrastructure), environmental (pollution/loss of biodiversity)

Hazard-risk equation (all values are **relative**): provides a relationship between different variables
R - risk
H - Hazard
V - Vulnerability
C - Capacity to cope

Risk hazard equation - R is risk, H is hazard, V is vulnerability, C is capacity to cope;;$R=(H*V)/C$
