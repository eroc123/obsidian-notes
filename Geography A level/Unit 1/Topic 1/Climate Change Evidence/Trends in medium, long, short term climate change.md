| Timescale   | Climate trends |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| Long term (800,000 years)   | Cycles of ice ages and warm periods, mainly due to variations in Earth's orbit (+- 10 degrees celsius)               |
| Medium term (10,000 years) | Minor variations (+-0.5 degrees celsius) from average, generally very stable. Little ice age from 1500-1800 is an example (-0.4 degrees from average) - due to being in the [[Geography A level/Unit 1/Topic 1/Climate Change/Key terms|holocene]]               |
| Short term (100-200 years)            | Rapid warming trend due to humans from CO2 emissions. (approx 1.1 degrees celsius above average and increasing)                |
