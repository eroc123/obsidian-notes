We can utilize several methods to find historical temperature data and carbon dioxide concentrations far into the past (several tens of thousands of years)

**Used for graphing long term climate change**

- **Ice cores**
 ;?;
	- Drilling into well-established ice sheets and extracting samples called ice cores - they hold a record of how the planet was in the past (100s of thousands of years)
		- This is because ice sheets are formed by the packing of layers upon layers of snow that have built over hundreds of years.
	- Ice cores contain dust, ash, pollen and gas bubbles (such as CO2 and Methane) from the atmosphere at the time when they first froze, providing information to how the atmosphere was like.
		- Allows for scientists to sample and create a record for historical data such as temperature and CO2 concentrations
- **Ocean sediment Cores**
 ;?;
	- Use of fossils from tiny marine animals in order to map out areas that historically had cold water, ocean currents/nutrient upwelling.
		- Calcium carbonate shells contain both light and heavy oxygen - heavy oxygen shells more common in areas with cold water
	- Areas with a thick layer of microfossils suggest areas of historical nutrient upwell
		- Gives a clue to ocean current patterns and hence historical wind patterns
	- If dust is found, the distribution can be charted and historical wind patterns can be charted.
- **Tree rings**
 ;?;
	- Trees can live for hundreds to thousands of years and the characteristics of tree rings can provide clues to the weather conditions during each year of a trees life.
