- Form at destructive plate boundaries
- Denser lithosphere sinks beneath less dense lithosphere in subduction - the denser lithosphere then melts
- Creates a trench when this happens


**Additional information**
- Mariana trench formed this way - Pacific plate sinks beneath Philippines plate.
- Volcanism occurs here, magma from melted plate rises to the surface through cracks in the mantle and erupts out of the crust.
