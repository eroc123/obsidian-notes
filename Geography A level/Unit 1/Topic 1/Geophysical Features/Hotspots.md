- Heat from mantle rises as a thermal plume 
- Lower pressure and high heat at base of lithosphere encourages rock melting
- Magma from the melting rock rises through cracks in the crust and forms volcanoes
- As plates move, a chain of volcanoes is formed, with old volcanoes cooling and eroding and new volcanoes being created in its spot

**Additional Info**
- Hotspots stay in the same geographical location whilst plates move, which cast away previously formed volcanoes and forms new volcanoes in its place. Creates island chains such as the Hawaiian Island chain (Pacific moves over hotspot, which keeps forming new volcanoes as old volcanoes go extinct)
- Old volcanoes start to cool and erode as they exit the thermal plume area and stop erupting
