1. Heat is generated in the Earth's core by the decay of radioactive elements and heat remaining from the formation of the Earth
2. Heat slowly rises through the mantle to the asthenosphere
3. Ridge push - the rising magma pushes into an oceanic ridge, which forces the two plates away
4. Plates float on the convection current of the asthenosphere
5. The denser oceanic slab sinks beneath a less dense continental plate when it hits a subduction zone.
