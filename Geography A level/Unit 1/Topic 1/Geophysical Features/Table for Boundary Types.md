| Constructive Plate Boundary | Low magnitude earthquakes generated by magma movement as plates are pulled apart                                                                   | Regular, low strength eruptions caused as magma rises and reaches the surface                                                                                           | Not normally generated here                                                                  |     |
| Destructive Plate Boundary  | Friction created by collision creates earthquakes with shallow to deep focus. High magnitude and seismically active                                | Violent, explosive, andesitic magma eruption; high hazard                                                                                                               | Generated here - due to undersea earthquakes where oceanic plates collide, e.g. 2004 tsunami |     |
| Conservative Plate Boundary | The plates experience friction and can experience stress buildup whilst sliding next to each other, creating shallow focus earthquake              | No volcanic activity                                                                                                                                                    | Tsunami's can form when undersea earthquakes generate here                                   |     |
| Other locations             | Mid plate earthquakes caused by reactivation of ancient faults. Continent-continent collision zones have high magnitude earthquakes e.g. Himalayas | Volcanic hotspots within continental plates can cause volanic eruptions - a hot spot in the mantle where plumes of magma rise to the surface and burn through the crust | Volcanic tsunami generated by volcano collapse, usually at subduction zones                  |     |
