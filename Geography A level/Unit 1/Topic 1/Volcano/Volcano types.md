**Fissure**
- Lava ejected through fissures instead of central vent
- Lava flows quickly and cools slowly, creating gentle slopes
- Basaltic lava usually forms large plateaus

**Shield Volcano**
- Lava ejected from central vent
- Lava flows long distances before cooling, creating gentle slopes
- Creates a cone shape with many layers

**Acid/dome volcanoes**
- Viscous, acid lava solidifies quickly - it does not go far from crater before solidifying
- Has steep slopes

**Ash and cinder cone volcanoes**
- Slopes built up by ash layers

**Composite**
- Built up with alternating layers of ash and lava

**Calderas**
- Huge explosions from gas buildup blow out the summit of the volcano, leaving a crater
- They can be flooded by the sea and turn into lagoons or have new cones
