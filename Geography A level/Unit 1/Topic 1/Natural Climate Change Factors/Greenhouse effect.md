##### Greenhouse Effect
1. incoming shortwave radiation (light) from the sun (solar radiation) hits the Earth
	- Some gets reflected by atmosphere
	- Some gets absorbed by atmosphere
	- Majority gets absorbed by surface
2. surface re-emits heat as longwave (infra-red) radiation 
	- some of the radiation escapes from planet Earth
	- some of the radiation gets absorbed by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and hence heat the earth further. 
- has a warming effect of around 30 degrees celsius up to an average of 15 degrees celsius for planet Earth.
##### Human Impact
- CO2 concentration has increased due to anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions
- This has caused more longwave radiation to be absorbed and contribute to increased warming, leading to the enhanced greenhouse effect.
- Methane concentration has also increased due to cattle ranching and other industries, also leading to enhanced greenhouse effect (methane is 25x more effective than CO2 as a greenhouse gas)
