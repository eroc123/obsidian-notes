- Are a series of planetary cycles based off of subtle variations in Earth's movement which affects its climate over thousands of years. 
- #### Three cycles
	- Eccentricity;; - variation in how elliptical Earth's orbit is (how circular Earth's orbit is)
		- Fluctuation due to gravitational pull by Jupiter and Saturn
		- When Earth is at its most elliptic, 23% more sunlight reaches Earth at its closest (perihelion) than when its furthest (aphelion)
		- Also affects length of seasons (more circular = more even seasons)
		- Currently Earth is near its least elliptic

	- Obliquity;; - how great is the Earth's axial tilt
		- Obliquity details ;?;
		- Varies between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees 
		- Currently tilted 23.4 degrees and slowly decreasing
		- Affects how extreme our seasons are, with higher tilt meaning hotter summers and colder winters. 
		- ![[axial tilt]]
	- **Precession**;;- how much Earth wobbles when it spins.
		- What precession causes;; Axial precession makes seasonal contrasts more extreme in one hemisphere and less extreme in the other
