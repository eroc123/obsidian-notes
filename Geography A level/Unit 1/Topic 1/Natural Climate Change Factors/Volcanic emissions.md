**Volcanic emission cooling**
- Large volumes of aerosols and ash are ejected into stratosphere during an eruption, e.g. sulfur dioxide 
- Aerosols reflect and scatter sunlight and increase Earth's albedo (reflectiveness),**causing cooling**
- Gases such as carbon dioxide trap warmth, **causing warming**
	- Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions dwarf volcanic emissions however, emitting 80-270 times more co2 in the same time period when compared to volcanic eruptions
- **Example:**
	- Mount Pinatubo on June 15, 1991 and ejected a 20 million ton sulfur dioxide cloud. Cooled Earth's surface for 3 years by around 1.3 degrees fahrenheit.
