| Name | Sustainable development | Carbon capture technology | Carbon-neutral development |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Definition | Reduced resource consumption, increase recycling of materials, locally sourced foodstuffs, alternative transport | Large scale carbon capture technology applied to power stations and industry, deep-sea or geological burial | Offsetting of all carbon emissions through afforestation, wholesale, switching to renewable energy |
| Scale | Local/regional | Global | Global/local/regional |
| Examples | a city builds public transport to reduce reliance on cars and reduce emissions | burying carbon from manufacturing into the deep sea | building solar panels to reduce fossil fuel dependence and hence reduce emissions from fossil fuel power |
| Extent that it is adaptation | somewhat adaptation, somewhat mitigation | Mostly mitigation | All mitigation |
| Other notes | lifestyle changes opposed, however it is known to work and some aspects already accepte | encourages us to continue unsustainable use of finite resources, however it does remove carbon at source and is advanced | could prevent development, public may oppose land-use and lifestyle changes, however it has a **massive** impact on emissions |
