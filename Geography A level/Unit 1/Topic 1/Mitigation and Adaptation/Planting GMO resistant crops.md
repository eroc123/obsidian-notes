##### Background
- due to climate change, there are longer droughts, heavier rains, winds, floods, disease.
- esp in Sub-Saharan Africa
- South Africa and Sudan are the only countries in SSA that have officially commercialized GM crops
- transitioning to more resilient crop varieties is needed to mitigate effects of climate change on food security in Sub-Saharan Africa
##### To adapt
- use GMO plants
	- disease resistant
	- fast-maturing
	- drought-tolerant
	- allows for farmers to take agriculture beyond subsistence - commercial and agro-processing
- accelerate GMO breeding 
	- using precise breeding methods avaliable through agricultural biotechnology
	- e.g. researchers in Uganda, Ghana are experimenting with a rice variety that is nitrogen and water-use efficient + salt-tolerant
	- e.g. in Uganda, they have developed  GM banana resistant to bacterial wilt and cassava resistant to brown streak and mosaic disease
##### Issues
- sociopolitical constraints prevent access to improved seeds
	- e.g. public getting mixed messages on whether biotech is good or bad
- lack of legal framework for guidance on usage of the crops
- attachment to indigenous varieties - resistance against using GMO's
- staple crops such as beans, bananas, and maize at risk of becoming unviable in certain areas due to climate change
