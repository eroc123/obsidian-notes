##### Background
- European agriculture has received some benefits from warming climate
	- longer growing season
	- more crops, esp. in Northern Europe
- Increased warming, however, leads to more extreme weather
	- e.g. droughts
	- e.g. extreme rainfall
	- **will eventually outweigh benefits**
##### Economic losses
- 16% by 2050
- May be due to disrupted development of crops such as grains, fruits, vegetables
	- Crops require a dry period before ripening and harvest
	- Wetter summers disrupts dry period
- Drought and excess heat in Southern Europe leads to less crop growth
	- land prices drop by 80% by end of century

##### Adaptations
- crop diversification
- precision farming
	- pesticides and fertilizers used in small amounts - reduces environmental impact of fertilizer runoff e.g. eutrophication
- saving water
- using heat-tolerant crops
##### Mitigations
- maintain soil health - soil can hold three times more carbon than atmosphere
