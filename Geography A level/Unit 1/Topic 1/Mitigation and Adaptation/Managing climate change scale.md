##### Individual
- **Mitigating** climate change by changing habits
	- Conserving water and electricity
	- Dietary changes, e.g. eating less red meat
	- Commuting more by active and public transport than by car
##### Local
- **Mitigating** climate change by changing city planning 
	- e.g. transport planning to allow for more active transport/public transport
	- recycling systems
	- rules on emissions
- **Adapting** to climate change based on local impacts
	- e.g. if a city is located on a floodplain, build flood defenses
##### National
- **Mitigating** climate change by reducing emissions
	- sequestering carbon
	- policies can be put in place for industry
- **Adapting** to climate change based on local impacts also + level of development
		- costs accumulate over time as effects of climate change emerge, hence more developed regions have higher ability to adapt
		- e.g. country like the Netherlands is capable of building large sea barriers to keep out storm surges whilst Bangladesh is less able to do so
##### Global
- **Mitigating** climate change by international agreements for global action
	- e.g. Paris accords - limit warming to 2 degrees
	- e.g. Kyoto Protocols - drop emissions by 5% relative to 1997 levels
	- e.g. Montreal Protocol - 1987 - phase out production and consumption of ozone depleting substances (cfc's)
