| Name | Land-use planning | Agricultural technology | Geoengineering |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Definition | Preventing floodplain development or on vulnerable coasts | Drought-resistant crops, no-tilage systems or drip irrigation systems | orbiting solar shields to deflect incoming solar radiation, ocean iron seeding to increase algal growth and sequester carbon |
| Scale | Local/regional | Local/regional | Global |
| Examples | if there is a flood, there will be less damage to cities or settlements | if there is a drought, the crops will survive | reduce global warming in the short term and give us time to reduce greenhouse gas emissions |
| Extent that it is adaptation | All adaptation | Mostly adaptation | Somewhat adaptation, somewhat mitigation |
| Other notes | reduce vulnerability to extreme weather, costly to implement and may be opposed by residents | costs may be too high, esp for developing world who need it the most - however it can be adopted quickly as tech exists | huge costs, untried tech, may give us a false sense of security and not change our lifestyle when its damaging |
