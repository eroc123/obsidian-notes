##### Background
- There have been historical floods near the Missouri river valley
	- in 1952 and in 1993 lasting 3 weeks
- Due to climate change, there is increased rainfall and shifting weather patters
	- usually 1 inch of rain in the past, now 4-6 inches in a 2-3 day wet spell
##### Impacts
- makes the land continuously muddy
	- makes it difficult to plant crops in the ground
- longer, hotter summers in midwest, heavier rains, more droughts
	- soil erosion due to increased rainfall - dry soil can only absorb 1.25 inches of rainfall over 24 hours after which it starts to erode
- reduction in us agricultural production
- increased vulnerability to pests
- adverse effects to livestock health due to air pollution and heat
##### Adaptations
- building drainage systems to cope with higher rainfall
- farmers become increasingly aware of climate change and its effects
	- before many were in denial or just accept it
