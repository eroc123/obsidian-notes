##### Background
- herders move seasonally from one place to another - especially in the northern Sahel
	- move south during dry season (November)
	- move north during wet season (June)
	- when they move south, they improve non-arable land, graze and fertilize fields after harvest and contribute to food security by selling milk and animals
- 75% of Sahel too dry to allow livestock herders to be sedentary
- move herds to [[Sahel background|available rangelands and water]]
- often far from medical centers
- [[Why the Sahel is so vulnerable to shifting climate belts|increasing population worsening issues]]
##### Impacts 
- dry season usually comes in early November in the northern Sahel, but now it starts in mid-October
- shorter wet season, longer dry season - up to 9 months
	- in 2010, there was a major drought which killed 4.8 million cattle - around 25% of the herd
- migrant pastoralists moving south earlier, [[Impacts of climate change on Sahel Region|disrupting farming activities of sedentary farmers further south]]
	 - trampling and destroying fields
	 - competing for water resources
##### Mitigation
- Regional Sahel Pastoralism Support Project
	- set up across six countries in Sahel
	- **Aim:**
		- protect pastoral systems
		- improve resource management and animal health
		- facilitating access to markets
		- diversing sources of income for pastoral households
		- managing conflicts
	- **Method of achieving aims:**
		- establishing infrastructure around water points
		- training provided by forestry and water officials for combating bushfires
		- preventing pastoral crises - upgrading early warning systems
			- setting up cattle feeding storage rooms
		- improving animal health
			- vaccinated 200 million animals
		- improving natural resource management
			- conflict resolution committees created in villages
