- Around 0.4-1m by 2100
- **Rate of sea level rise is accelerating**
	- due to positive feedback loops, e.g. [[Geography A level/Unit 1/Topic 1/Climate Change Scenarios/Ice albedo feedback|Ice albedo feedback]], [[Carbon ocean sink]]
- Difficult to predict due to many [[Climate Change Scenarios|factors]]
	- sea level rise closely tied to success of mitigation actions
- General trend is a rise in sea level over time
