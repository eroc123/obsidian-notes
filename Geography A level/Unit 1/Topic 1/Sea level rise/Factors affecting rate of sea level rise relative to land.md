- [[Geography A level/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Erosional processes and landforms/Key coast terms|Isostatic change]] of the land (subsiding or rebouding) can also change effects of sea level
- In most deltas, due to sediment starvation, the land is sinking
	- Sediment starvation: When sediment gets trapped behind human-made structures like a dam and restricts sediment flow downstream
	- There is still erosion of river deltas, but no deposition left, hence river deltas erode.
- Excessive groundwater pumping 
	- Leads to land **subsidence** as land cannot support building weight anymore
	- good example in Bangkok
- Location in a tropical storm belt makes you more vulnerable to the effects of sea level rise.
