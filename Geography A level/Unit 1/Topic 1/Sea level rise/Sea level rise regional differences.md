- **Sea level does not rise identically in every region**
	- Increase in temperature takes place at different stages in the vertical water column
	- [[obsidian-notes/Geography A level/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Erosional processes and landforms/Key coast terms|Isostatic]] change of land can magnify or mitigate sea level rise effects.
