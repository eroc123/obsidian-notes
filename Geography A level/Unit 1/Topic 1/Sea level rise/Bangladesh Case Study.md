- Bangladesh is a very low lying country (only a few meters above sea level), dominated by the Ganges river delta.

#### Impacts on Bangladesh by sea level rise
- Cause topsoil erosion
- Migration to other countries or into city areas - often into [[obsidian-notes/Geography A level/Urban/L1 Urban Issues/Slums|slums]]
- Cause saltwater intrustion into rivers (contaminate freshwater) - **salinisation** 
	- contaminates coastal drinking water - 33 million people vulnerable
	- damages agriculture - also at risk from soil erosion
- Strengthening monsoons and tropical storms will lead to increased flooding, including coastal flooding from storm surges
- Flooding of agricultural land 
	- Worse since many people rely on subsistence farming
#### Factors causing/worsening effects of sea level rise
- Gender inequality - female headed housholds may be less able to secure sufficient funds to rebuild due to gender biases.
- Poverty - people less able to cope with disasters
	- Agricultural land may be damaged, which subsistence farmers rely on for food and income (66% of people live in rural areas and rely on agriculture)
- Lack of economic resources 
- Heavy monsoon rains and Himalayan glacial melt - worsens flooding
- Storm surges and tropical cyclones
#### Solutions/mitigations to issues
- Farmers finding new ways of working with flooded fields
	- New methods such as:
		- Utilizing seedbeds that sit atop of water - built with water hyacinth and bambo.
		- Seeds can be planted in the seedbeds and they float on the water, e.g. spinach and okra
	- Changing jobs, such as to:
		- shrimp farming
		- duck rearing
		- crab fattening
	- Utilizing salt-resistant varieties of rice
		- they can grow in saline water
- Flood defenses
	- Building embankments
	- Dams planned
	- Building elevated homes
