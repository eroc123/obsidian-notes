| Factor                                    | Explanation                                                                                                                                                       |

| Topography and relief (shape of the land) | ==Loose rocks and soil (perhaps due to weathering or erosion) are less likely to be bound strongly together.                                                      |
| Slope material                            | Building on slopes can alter the stability of the land, either by disrupting surface layers of material, or by altering the shape of the slope.                   |
| Geology                                   | Steeper slopes are more likely to experience landslides as there is a greater force of gravity being exerted.                                                     |
| Deforestation                             | Water can trigger landslides and mudslides because it alters the pressure within the slope, which leads to slope instability.                                     |
| Heavy rainfall                            | The rock type influences the extent to which water can seep into the ground. Permeable rocks absorb more water which can make them more vulnerable to landslides. |
| Earthquake / volcanic eruption            | Tree roots bind the earth together. Removing them makes the ground less stable.                                                                                   |
| Construction                              | Tremors and shaking of ground will mean that any existing weaknesses are tested; if the ground is not strong enough a landslide will be triggered.                |
