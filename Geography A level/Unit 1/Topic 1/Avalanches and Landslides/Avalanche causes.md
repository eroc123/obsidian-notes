avalanche;;the mass movement of snow down a hillside
<!--SR:!2024-04-20,3,250-->

avalanche requirements
;?;
- Require a slope angle of 35-50 degrees - highest risk slope
- Requires a large buildup of snow , which can occur from snowstorms (reason why its a
- There are two types of avalanches, loose snow avalanche and slab avalanche
	- loose snow avalanche is when the snow flows down unconsolidated
	- slab avalanches is when the snow falls down in one big consolidated block - **more dangerous**

avalanche triggers
;?;
- There can be both human and physical triggers
	- Human triggers include skiing, snowboarding, snowmobiling
	- Physical triggers include earthquakes, snowstorms.

avalanche composition
;?;
[[Complex hazards]] specifically in three layers:
	- Surface bed of snow - this is a strong, compacted layer of snow at the bottom
	- Weak, intermediate snow layer - this is a weak layer of unconsolidated snow which can give way
	- Overlying slab snow - this is the fresh snow that has piled up on the intermediate snow layer

#### Chamoli Disaster


##### What occured
- Large chunk of a mountain flank in the ==Himalayas (Ronti Peak)==, around 80% rock 20% ice broke off
- The mixture of rock and ice fell 2 km, with the friction of the rock heating up the ice enough to melt almost all of it into water

##### What the disaster caused
- The rock avalanche had the consistency of concrete mix and allowed it to flow further downstream into a river, which caused it to ==destroy dams several 10's of kilometers downstream==
	- Destroyed the ==Rishiganga hydro-electric plant 15 km downstream== from where the collapse occured
- Rock avalanches may become more often as climate change worsens. This is because overlying glaciers are melting faster, removing the glacial weight and causing destabilisation of the rock layers below.
