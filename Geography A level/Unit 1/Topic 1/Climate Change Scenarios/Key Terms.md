**Tipping point** - a critical threshold at which a system undergoes a sudden and significant change, often irreversible
**Anthropogenic** - caused by human activity
**Albedo** - the reflectivity of a surface
**Forest die back** - occurs when a large number of trees in a forest die off, typically due to environmental stressors such as drought, disease, or insect infestation
**Feedback mechanism** - processes that amplify or dampen the effects of changes in a system (positive feedback amplifies changes, while negative feedback stabilizes or counteracts them)
