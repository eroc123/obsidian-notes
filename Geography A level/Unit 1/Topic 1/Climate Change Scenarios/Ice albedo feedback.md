- Ice is more reflective than water or land and reflects sunlight
- When there is warming, ice melts and ice cover shrinks
- When ice cover shrinks, more water surface is exposed which is darker than ice
- Dark water surface absorbs more sunlight and warms
- Increased warming of ocean melts more ice and reduces ice surface - positive feedback
