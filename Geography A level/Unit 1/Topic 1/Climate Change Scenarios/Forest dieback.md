#### In the amazon
- **Threshold 1**: amount of annual rainfall below which adult Amazon trees start to die and **increase fire susceptibility**
- **Threshold 2:** Fire - severity of fire beyond which Amazon is replaced by scrub vegetation - **forest does not regrow**
- **Threshold 3:** Forest loss and rainfall inhibition - "tipping point" - area of forest loss beyond which rainfall is sufficiently reduced, **causing increased risk of threshold 1 and 2.** Positive feedback loop
