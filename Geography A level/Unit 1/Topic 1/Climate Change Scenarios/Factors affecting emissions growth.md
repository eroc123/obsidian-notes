- economic growth
- population growth
- Technological development
- Geographical distribution of human settlements and urban structures

	- living in suburbs generally require longer commutes or private transport - increases GHG emissions
- Consumption patterns (housing patterns, leisure activities, diet - whether its vegetarian or meat based)
- Extent to which countries mitigate against GHG emissions
