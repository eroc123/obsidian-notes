The ocean is an important sink that has historically taken up large amounts of anthropogenic CO2 emissions.

#### Issues as surface waters warm

###### Warm waters hold less CO2
- When surface waters warm, they are less able to hold CO2
- More CO2 ends up in atmosphere and causes enhanced greenhouse effect - positive feedback loop

###### Ocean acidification
- When CO2 is sequestered by the ocean, the ocean becomes more acidic
- When ocean becomes more acidic, creatures with calcium carbonate shells  - e.g. coral and Foraminifera - (CaCO3) start to dissolve
- Organisms die off
- Organisms can no longer sequester carbon
- More carbon ends up in atmosphere which can enhance greenhouse effect and be sequestered by ocean - positive feedback loop

###### Thermohaline circulation breakdown
- Rising surface temperatures slow down thermohaline circulation 
	- can reduce the volume of ocean water sinking into deep waters due to increased temperature in addition to reduced salinity
	- reduced salinity caused by melting arctic ice sheets which release freshwater
- Thermohaline circulation helps bury carbon in deep ocean - if it stops, carbon is no longer buried
- Carbon ends up in atmosphere and contributes to more warming - positive feedback loop
