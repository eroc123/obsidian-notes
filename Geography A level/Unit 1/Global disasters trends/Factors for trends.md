| Factor | Explanation |
| ---- | ---- |
| Land pressure | Leads to land degradation: deforestation for timber and farming beyond the margin lead to desertification, soil degradation and increased pollution |
| Economic development | Leads to e.g. clearance of mangroves which protect coast from tsunamis/storm surges |
| Population growth and change | More people means more vulnerable people, especially the elderly and young. Increasing pressure at coasts too |
| Political change | Corrupt governments or war can exert extra pressure on land. They can also mismanage disaster relief efforts |
| Rapid urbanization and growth of megacities | Leads to many people living in squatter settlements at high risk from flooding or landslides |
| Economic growth | Increases value of property and infrastructure, increasing economic impacts. |
| Poverty | Means many less developed countries cannot afford disaster management and support for vulnerable people |
| Technological innovation | Controls hazards but does not protect against major disasters; can also encourage people to build in danger zones |
