| Viscosity          | Very fluid - low viscoscity                                             | High                                                               |
| Temperature        | 1000-1200 degrees celsius                               | 800 - 1200 degrees celsius                                         |
| Silica content     | Low silica content                                      | High                                                               |
| Gas content        | Low (0.5%-2%)                                           | High - gasses cannot escape and build up, causing violent eruption |
| Location           | Ocean hot spots, mid-ocean ridges, shield volcanoes     | Stratovolcanoes - form at subduction plate boundaries              |
| Eruption frequency | More frequent, less violent and usually doesn't explode | Eruptions are less frequent but violent due to buildup of gases    |
