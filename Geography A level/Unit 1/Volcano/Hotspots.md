- Region on the Earth's surface where large amounts of heat and magma rises from the mantle up to the base of the lithosphere as large **mantle plumes**. 
- The heat and hot magma spread out when the thermal plume hits the base of the lithosphere to a width of 500-1000 km - called **diapirs**
- Does not form on plate boundaries
- Hotposts **stay in the same geographic location** or move very slowly through geological timescales
	- Since plates continue to move, this can create island chains as new areas of the plate are exposed to volcanic activity and old areas are cut off.
	- They dont move along with tectonic plates
	- e.g. Hawaiian island chain formed this way- this is why its a line of islands
