- Line city, utilizes "superblock" squares which will be self-sufficient and contain services
- Uses public transport such as hyper-speed trains down its length
- Envisions a city fuelled by renewables and supplied with desalinated water
- Is displacing lots of tribes and people in the area (several dead)
- Saudi Arabia still produces huge volumes of fossil fuels and uses it for energy production - undermines creditability of the project
