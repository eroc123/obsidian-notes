#### Cause
- Collapse of Britain's industrial and manufacturing sector
- Hence, loss of jobs cause unemployment and social exclusion
#### Issues with current plans
- Programmes sometimes get dropped
- Due to the duration of time needed to complete these plans, government programmes that initially funded them often get replaced
- e.g. single regeneration budget (SRB)

#### New Focus
- Changing from physical regeneration (e.g. housing) to economic and social regeneration
- Regional agencies now are tasked increasingly with economic regeneration, especially since they have been provided with more cash and flexibility
- Labour government's flagship regeneration scheme launched in 1998 with 39 projects.
- Main incentives: umemployment, poor health,crime and education, tax incentives, for urban regeneration governments
