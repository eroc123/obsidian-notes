#### Deindustrialization 
- When factories and manufacturing move out of an area, causing unemployment.
	  - Middle aged men who worked in factories are difficult to retrain due to narrow skillset
	  - Example: Detroit used to be auto manufacturing hub, however automobile manufacturing has been moved out and been outsourced, causing unemployment.
#### Depopulation 
- Loss of opportunities 
- People migrate away, generally young, skilled workers with financial resources - brain drain. Reduces productivity
- A highly dependent residual population is left behind

#### Dereliction:
- Caused in part by depopulation 
- Buildings are unused and abandoned, causing them to fall into disrepair
- Councils unable to maintain environmental quality of an area - discourage investment
#### Deprivation: 
- End result is deprevation 
- Lacks what is "normal" in society, e.g. housing, income, health, mobility, opportunity
