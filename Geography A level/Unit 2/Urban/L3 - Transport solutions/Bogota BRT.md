**Issues:**
- Very dense city - largest urban area in colombia
- Had lots of failed transit plans - ageing bus systems, too many private operators
- Lack of ridership - only 45% occupied
- Lack of speed - average trip was 1 hour 10 minutes
**Solutions:**
- The creation of a BRT system - characteristics of metro but much cheaper. 
- Successfully created from plan to implementation within 3 years, partially due to the strong political will of Bogota's mayor, Enrique Penalosa.
**Features:**
- 58 km of busways, 309 km feeder routes, 800,000 people daily capacity
- Red, articulated (or bi-articulated busses) - busses that utilize rubber seperators between carriages to allow them to turn more easily
- Capacity of 160 passengars
- Utilizes reserved corridors and covered walkways - in case it rains.l
**Why it succeeded:**
- Affordable
- Provide public transport needs of the city.
- No operating subsidy
- Significant increase in public transit.
