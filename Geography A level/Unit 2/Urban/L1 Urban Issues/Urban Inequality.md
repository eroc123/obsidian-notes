#### Gini coefficient

0 means absolute equality

#### Connection between income inequality and employment sectors

	- Therefore, having a higher education allows you to have higher paying jobs and higher income

#### Gated communities

- Gated communities associated with wealthy people, creating inequalities between gated communities and non-gated communities.
