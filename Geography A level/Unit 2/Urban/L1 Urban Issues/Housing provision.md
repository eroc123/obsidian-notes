#### Housing shortage
- Insufficient amount of housing to accomodate the population, when the supply of houses doesn't meet housing demand.
#### Housing affordability
- Cost of housing and shelters in relation to a person's/household's disposable income in order to pay for the houses.
#### Causes of Inbalance in Housing Demand and Supply
- Expensive private housing (lower supply)
- More people living in the suburb (higher demand)
- Divorce, single families occupying more houses' (higher demand)
- Immigration (higher demand)
- High land value demanded (lower supply)
- Demographic change 
- Population growth
#### Problems caused
- Affordability
	- Lack of supply or too much demand pushes prices up and means that less people can afford the property.
- Homelessness
	- People who cannot afford houses may result in homelessness
	- Rent can also rise and force people to use more of their disposable income to pay rent
- Household crowding
	- Not enough housing supply or houses are too expensive, therefore lots of people have to share a small space to save money.
- Housing insecurity
	- Increases uncertainty for individuals and families
	- Causes stress about rising rents and living conditions
