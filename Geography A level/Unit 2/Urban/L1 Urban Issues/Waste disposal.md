E.g. bricks, tiles, asbestos |

#### Why is waste disposal difficult in dense areas?
- High population density
- Limited amount of space
- Heath and sanitation issues
- Transportation and logistical issues (e.g. bad roads such as in [[Geography A level/Unit 2/Urban/L1 Urban Issues/Slums]])

#### Problems with landfills
- Environmental pollution
- Air pollution - methane can be released causing greenhouse gas effect
- Odor and nuisance
- Wildlife and pest attraction
- land use conflicts
#### Illegal Dumping
- Defined as a large deposit of waste (not just basic littering, but dumping large amounts of garbage). Usually anything thats over 15 pounds or 27 cubic feet in open areas like woods, alleys and parking lots
#### Causes of illegal dumping
- Lack of education - people may not be aware of its environmental effects
- Lack of legal disposal options - there may be a lack of garbage collection system or options to dispose of garbage so people just partake in illegal dumping
- Lack of monitoring or enforcement of laws
#### Solutions
- **Recycling programs:** Establish and expand recycling programs, including for paper, glass, plastic
- **Innovation and technology:** invest in innovative waste management technologies such as waste sorting robots and advanced recycling systems.
- **Waste reduction at the source:** Promote awareness and education about waste reduction strategies and about making sustainable choices.
