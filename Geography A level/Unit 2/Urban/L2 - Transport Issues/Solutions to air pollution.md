#### London 
**Causes of air pollution:**
- Home heating using low quality coal releases sulfur dioxide emissions
- Heavy industries and power plants in city center pump chemicals into air
- Weather conditions such as anticyclones trapping cold air beneath a layer of warm air within the city, trapping pollutants with it.
- Example was the Great Smog of 1952 from 5th-9th of December, where air pollution was so bad that visibility was reduced to only a few meters. 
	- Caused by heavy pollution and weather conditions trapping the pollutants within the city.
	- Caused 4000-12000 deaths within just a few days, combined with heightened mortality and other ill effects long after the smog cleared.
	- This included lower intelligence and increased risk of respiratory problems for infants who lived through the smoggy period.
**Solutions:**
- Clean air act passed in 1956
- Smoke control implemented, only smokeless fuels can be burnt.
- Ultra low emission zone implemented - charging drivers of polluting vehicles
#### Beijing
**Causes:**
- Rapid industrialization 
- Coal-burning power stations and a vehicle boom caused increase in air pollution emissions.
**Solutions:**
- Implementing ultra low emission standards - forcing old vehicles off the road
- Implementing public transit (encourage people to use clean transit instead of driving)
- Implementing advanced air quality monitoring systems
- Shifting from coal to natural gas (natural gas is cleaner)
#### Mexico City
**Causes:**
- Geography - being situated in a high altitude mountain valley meant that smog often gets trapped
- Very high population and high number of cars leads to bad air pollution
**Solutions:**
- Curb the number of cars on the road by 20% in 1989
- Expansion of public transport
- Stricter vehicle emission standards
Unfortuantely, the situation in Mexico city has started to deteriorate again due to increasing population, longer commute times and the reliance on old, dirty busses for commuting.
