- **Frost-shattering (freeze thaw):**
	- [[Geography A level/Unit 2/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Erosional processes and landforms/Weathering and erosion|Is mechanical]]
	- Occurs when water seems into cracks and expands when it freezes, widening the cracks.
	- Occurs in places where night temperatures drop below freezing
- **Salt crystallization:**
	- [[Geography A level/Unit 2/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Erosional processes and landforms/Weathering and erosion|Is mechanical]]
	- Salt water attacks cliffs or rocks
	- Water evaporates, leaving behind minerals like salt in cracks
	- Crystals grow and force the cracks apart
- **Oxidation:**
	- [[Geography A level/Unit 2/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Erosional processes and landforms/Weathering and erosion|Is chemical]]
	- Oxygen combines with iron-based minerals and changes it chemically
	- Causes rock to crumble
- **Seaweed acids:**
	- [[Geography A level/Unit 2/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Erosional processes and landforms/Weathering and erosion|Is biological]]
	- Seaweed such as kelp contain acid like sulphuric acid
	- Acid dissolves some rock minerals 
- **Boring molluscs:**
	- [[Geography A level/Unit 2/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Erosional processes and landforms/Weathering and erosion|Is biological]]
	- Live on coastal rocks, scrape at the rock surface for food and dig holes for homes.
- **Plant roots**:
	- [[Geography A level/Unit 2/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Erosional processes and landforms/Weathering and erosion|Is biological]]
	- Plant roots can put stress or pressure on rocks
- **Acids in rainwater**:
	- [[Geography A level/Unit 2/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Erosional processes and landforms/Weathering and erosion|Is chemical]]
	- Acids in rainwater (such as CO2 which is called carbonation) can dissolve certain minerals.
