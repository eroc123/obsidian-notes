## Steep Cliffs

- Steep cliffs occur where rocks are strong and resistant to erosion, e.g. igneous and metamorphic rocks
- They dip steeply or vertically into the sea
- Absence of beach
- Often very exposed to [[Geography A level/Unit 2/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Waves/Destructive waves|high energy waves]] and faces open ocean (long fetch)

## Gentle Cliffs

- Weak or unconsolidated rocks that slump
- Low angle dip towards the sea
- Debris can build up on the foot of the cliffs due to low energy environment ([[Geography A level/Unit 2/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Waves/Constructive waves|low energy waves]] with short fetch)
- Can feature wide beaches
