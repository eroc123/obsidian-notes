- **Temperature**
	- Colder climates have more [[Geography A level/Unit 2/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Erosional processes and landforms/Weathering and erosion|mechanical weathering]], e.g. freeze thaw
	- Warmer climates have more [[Geography A level/Unit 2/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Erosional processes and landforms/Weathering and erosion|chemical weathering]] as chemical reactions speed up
	- [[Geography A level/Unit 2/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Erosional processes and landforms/Weathering and erosion|Biological weathering]] increases in warm climates
- **Humidity and rainfall**
	- Higher rainfall leads to higher [[Geography A level/Unit 2/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Erosional processes and landforms/Weathering and erosion|biological weathering and chemical weathering]]
