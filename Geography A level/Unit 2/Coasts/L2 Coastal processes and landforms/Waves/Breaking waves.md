- **Water in waves move in circular motion while its travelling through open ocean**
![[Geography A level/Unit 2/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Images/wave breaking.png]]
- **Friction** slows the waves down as they hit shallower water.
- This creates **elliptical motion** of the water in the waves, where the top moves faster than the bottom.
- Eventually, the top of the wave breaks over and crashes.
