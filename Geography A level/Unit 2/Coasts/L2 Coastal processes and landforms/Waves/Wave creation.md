- When wind blows over the surface of a water body, friction leads to ripples on the surface.

- Wind is the movement of air from one location to another, and flows down a pressure gradient from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure.
	- The greater the pressure difference, the faster and stronger the wind is.
	
- Tsunamis are caused by tectonic movement, not by wind.
