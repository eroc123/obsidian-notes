- A sediment cell is a system that can be used to classify sections of coast
- Along a section of coast, deposition, erosion and transportation all take place within a linked system
- Each cell is a [[Geography A level/Unit 2/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Sediment Cell Concept/System (geography)|closed system]] with little transfer between them in theory, however there are circumstances where there is transfer between major cells
	- [[Geography A level/Unit 2/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Erosional processes and landforms/Erosion]] is regarded as a **source** as it inputs sediment to the cell
	- [[Geography A level/Unit 2/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Erosional processes and landforms/Key coast terms#**Deposition - the process by which sediment is released from flowing water when it loses energy**|Deposition]] is regarded as a **sink** as that is where sediment goes to and is "used up".
	- Transportation via [[Geography A level/Unit 2/Coasts/L2 Coastal processes and landforms/Transporation and Depositional landforms/Longshore Drift]] transports sediment from the **source** to the **sink**
