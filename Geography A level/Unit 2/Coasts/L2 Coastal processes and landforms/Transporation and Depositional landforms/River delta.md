- Formed when a river meets a lake or the sea
	- River current gets slowed down and causes deposition as it loses energy.
	- A delta builds up when more material gets deposited than eroded away.
- Characteristics include: islands which extend above the water, river splitting up into multiple channels (distributaries)
