##### About
- Studland beaches in the UK are very popular, especially in summer when there can be up to 25,000 people on the beaches at once.

**Impacts**
- Is a natural area of sand dunes, which are vulnerable to dune erosion and destabilisation, especially with visitor pressure
- Litter and dog mess (litter from cigarette butts are especially bad as they can start fires)
- Footpath erosion - can also cause dune erosion
- Area is home to a large number of rare species of plants and birds - tourists can cause species disturbance
- Demand for facilities such as parking, paths and toilets
**Solutions**
- Clearly labelling footpaths to minimize trample damage to other areas
- Fencing off [[blowouts]] and restabilizing dunes with marram grass
- Providing car parks - cars cannot drive onto the beach
- Fire beaters are positioned within dunes to prevent fire - a tool to hit a fire to put it out.
- facilities positioned near car parks to concentrate tourists in one area and away from beach
- Bins - for litter and dog mess (dog poop)
- Visitors educated about environment and how they can protect it
