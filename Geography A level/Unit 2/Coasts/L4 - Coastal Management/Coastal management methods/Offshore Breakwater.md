**How it works:**
- Offshore concrete walls that break up waves and thus absorb their wave energy to reduce their erosive power significantly by the time they reach the coast

**Pros:**
- Effective at reducing erosion
- Low maintenance
- Does not prevent natural dune processes from taking place
**Cons:**
- Can be easily destroyed during storms
- May not look particularly appealing
