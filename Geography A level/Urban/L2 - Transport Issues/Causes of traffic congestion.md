- No real alternatives to driving
	- No public transit options - therefore people must use private vehicles to get around
	- Chiang Mai is a good examplew
- Drivers looking for parking spaces
	- 30% of traffic is caused by drivers looking for parking
	- Looking for especially where on and off street parking is avaliable (or where there is a big price difference between metered on street parking and off street parking)
- Cash-based toll collection
	- Traffic builds up quickly when cars have to slow down to pay tolls especially at rush hour
- Traffic signals are not optimized
	- Traffic signals may be timed for a different kind of flow, meaning that less traffic passes through than possible
- Road capacities maxed out
	- Not enough road surface, especially in older cities (especially European cities) with small, winding roads. It is less of a problem in newer cities like Dubai.
- No priority for public transport
	- Give the same priority to cars as they do with public transit. That means that bikes, trams and busses all have to share the same space with cars - causes congestion and also discourages the use of those modes of transport. 
- Driver behavior
	- If one driver brakes on a highway, the following cars have to brake too and this creates a phantom traffic jam, where there is no physical trigger for the traffic jam.
