**Cars emit:**
- Hydrocarbon compounds - carbon hydrogen compounds
- Particulate matter
- Nitrogen Oxides 
- Carbon monoxide - carbon fuel doesn't combust completely
**Effects of pollutants:**
- Hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides combine to produce ozone
- Air pollutants emitted from cars can cause cancer and irritate skin, eyes
- Emissions from cars increase level of $CO_2$ and other greenhouse gases in atmosphere

Difficult to calclate how much air emissions are released from cars due to the fact that pollution can be released from many other different sources such as home heating, construction and manufacturing.
