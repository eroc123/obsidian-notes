This is a scheme aimed at improving slums but by private companies and with profit in mind. 

**The latest redevelopment plan:**
- Raze the Dharavi slum and construct new housing, retail, schools and parks in the area.
	- 2.8 million square meters will be razed and replaced with new buildings
- Slum residents will be given flats in high rise residential buildings.
- Old, informal industries within the slum such as pottery would be replaced with new, formal and clean industry on the site.
- Benefits to:
	- The slum dwellers - they get better living conditions and get access to better services such as education
	- The private developers - they get access to extremely valuable land in the center of Mumbai to build offices, shopping malls, etc.
**Concerns against this plan:**
- Living space of flats will be smaller than their original homes
- Loss of small informal businesses and industries such as pottery that residents rely on for a living
- Relocation to an area far from the city center - reduced job opportunity.
- Demolition of the slum - proves unpopular amongst many
