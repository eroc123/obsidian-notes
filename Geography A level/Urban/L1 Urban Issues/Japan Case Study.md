**Background**
- Japan has a low landmass and high population density
- Fast economic growth in the 60's led to a huge increase in the volume of waste produced.
- In 2011, Japan produced 2117 tonnes of Municipal Solid Waste per day.
- Fukuoka (福岡) has an effective waste collection system (100% of waste collected)
**Solutions:**
- Waste transfer stations are used, where waste can be transferred from smaller to larger trucks
- 84.5 tonnes of waste is recycled per day whilst 1777 tonnes per day are incinerated, allows for electricity production,
- 15% of city's waste still goes to landfill.
- Fukouka Method is used to develop landfill structures and allows for refuse to be quickly broken down. This allows site to be stabilized quickly and filled to allow the land to be used for other purposes.
