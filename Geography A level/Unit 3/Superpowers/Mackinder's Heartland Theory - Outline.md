#### Outline
- Geostrategic heartland theory
- Theory states whoever controlled the "world island" (the heartland) with the "pivot" at the center of it would control the world
	- in our world this heartland" stretches from eastern Europe to Russia - basically whoever controlled most of Asia and Europe
- **Based off concept that control of a landlocked region could allow for great power - radical as in 1904 control of the seas was what allowed for power**


##### Theory
- whoever controls the most strategic part of europe controls the heartland -> controls world island -> controls world
- the further away from the heartland the less power one has
