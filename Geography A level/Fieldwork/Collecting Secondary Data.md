- Utilizing GIS
	- Google maps
		- Allow us to get a better visualization of the state of the roads, traffic, transport, infrastructure (such as if there are alot of potholes)
		- Identify suitable points for data collection (finding junctions, finding busy areas, finding big/small roads) 
		- Overview of the city
		- See current state of road system and urban planning 
		- Options for viewing in 3D and 2D (allow us to edit and create route maps)
		- Provide us an estimated walking time which helps with time management later on
	- Google street view
		- Supports in finding suitable points and vizualizing the state of the transport system beforehand (identifying key features such as bike sharing system, congestion, traffic lights, road quality)
- Utilizing the Internet
- Social media
- Find personal anecdotes of long term residents on the state of traffiแ
- Local opinions on previous plans
- Historical state of the transport (whether it improved, not improved)
- Complaints
- Find news reports on key issues and conflicts about the traffic system 
- E.g. issues with setting up public transport or failed plans
- Searching for articles
    

- Interviews on the issue
    
- Proposed solutions to the issue
    
- Previous studies on the traffic provision and how to resolve it
    

- Geographical models [Transport Models](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18tvaLDZOGWDF6rWF9M8gfZVvD1cGGFQMurbh8oPg9GI/edit#heading=h.kutr81dh39ny)
    

- White and Senior’s 5 factors determining transport (1983):
    

- Technology - what technology is available to develop transport?
    

- E.g. to build an automatic toll gate you need the necessary available technology to allow its smooth operation and implementation
    
- In Chiang Mai’s case, there has been the implementation of bike sharing and other applications, showing how smartphone technology has led to the creation of these systems.
    

- Historical - what existing structures, developments and layouts are already there?
    

- Chiang Mai is an old city, therefore, many of its roads are small and winding, reducing traffic capacity
    
- Also makes it hard to implement significant infrastructure changes due to historical sites and buildings (such as road expansions and new junctions)
    

- Physical factor - climate, topography
    

- Chiang Mai is hot, reducing the practicality of active transport
    
- Bounded by mountains and has rivers flowing through the city, shaping how the city is developed
    

- Economic factor
    

- How much people are willing to pay to develop and maintain new transportation
    

- Political and social factors
    

- Government working in capital
    
- Competition
    
- Safety and working conditions
    
- Coordination between different types of transport
    
- E.g. in Thailand, there is a lot of buerocracy and corruption, hampering infrastructure projects.
    

- Gap model of service quality (1985):
    

- Gap 1: Knowledge Gap
    

- Perception of customers need differs from actual need
    

- Gap 2: Policy Gap
    

- Perception of customers standard is different from actual standard/quality
    

- Gap 3: Delivery Gap
    

- Service implementation quality differs from the quality standards that have been set and promised
    

- Gap 4:  Communication Gap
    

- When the delivered service does not match the quality that has been advertised
    

- Gap 5: Perception gap
    

- The overall difference  in actual service quality compared to what the customer’s perception of it is
    

- We hypothesize that many of the solutions that Chiang Mai have tried to implement have suffered from many of the problems outlined by the gap model of service quality.
    

- Examples are: bike sharing and scooter sharing (knowledge an delivery gap)
    
- Crosswalk with traffic light implementation (ddelivery gap, knowledge gap)
