- a way to measure angle between two vectors in a vector space 
- binary operation that takes two vectors and returns a scalar value 
- defined as matrix product of the transpose of the first vector with the second
	- basically, first vector is transposed and multipled with the second vector
	- $u^T*v = u_1v_1+u_2v_2...u_nv_n$
	- result is a scalar
	- denoated as (u,v) or (u|v)
